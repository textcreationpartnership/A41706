            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ins have their faſhions as wel as Garments: And the great ſin in faſhion now adays is <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme.</hi> A ſin not openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, yea ſcarce heard of, in the Infant-ſtate of the World; when the miraculous operations of the Deitie, in the Creation and Gubernation of althings, were ſo freſh and conſpicuous. But in elder Times, when Philoſophie in the Scholes, and Human Policie in ſtates began to prevail, then began Atheiſme to ſpring up therewith. Yet could it never obtain any conſiderable vogue, or Reputation 'til of late years. But now, alas! alas! how hath it, in a few years, overſpread the Chriſtian world? And what have been the ſeeds of this prodigious ſin, ſo much repugnant to human Nature, but <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie</hi> and <hi>carnal ſecuritie, as to the coming of the Day of God?</hi> This the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> by a Spirit of propheſie, diſtinctly foretold, <hi>2</hi> Pet. <hi>3.3, 4. knowing this firſt, that there ſhal come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying, where is the promiſſe of his coming?</hi> &amp;c. What are the <hi>Laſt days,</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> here refers unto, but this laſt Period of the world, in which we live?
<pb facs="tcp:53798:3"/>And who are the <hi>Scoffers</hi> he makes mention of, but Atheiſtic ſenſual ſinners, who put far from them the coming of our Lord to jugement? Neither have theſe ſins of <hi>Atheiſme, Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,</hi> and <hi>carnal ſecuritie</hi> diffuſed their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Influences through the debauched and ſuperſtitious World only, but alſo through many Reformed Churches. O! What a world of <hi>practic Atheiſme</hi> and <hi>Infidelitie</hi> is to be found among many profeſſors of Religion? Do not the Lives of too many notional Profeſſors evidently demonſtrate to us, that they <hi>really</hi> believe not what they profeſſe? What may we judge of the ſenſual profeſſor, whoſe main ſtudie and care is to gratifie his brutiſh Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite? Can we imagine that he believeth what he profeſſeth, touching the coming of the day of God? No Surely. And may we not conclude the ſame of the Avaricious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuous profeſſor, whoſe main deſigne is to fil his bags, with Gold and Silver? Did he indeed believe the coming of his Lord, how ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would he be to improve his <hi>unrighteous mammon,</hi> to the beſt advantage for his maſter's ſervice? But to aſcend higher to the forme of more refined profeſſors, has not a ſpiritual ſlumber of carnal ſecuritie ſeized on the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie of Profeſſors, both <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fooliſh Virgins?</hi> Are not the Fooliſh Virgins or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal profeſſors, at this day, under a dead ſleep of carnal ſecuritie? Yea, do not the <hi>Wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> alſo <hi>ſlumber,</hi> if not <hi>ſleep?</hi> I know not of any piece of Scripture more applicable to theſe days we live in, than that of our Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:53798:3"/>Mat. <hi>25.5. While the Bridegroom tarried they al ſlumbered and ſlept.</hi> This is the curſe of theſe laſt days, <hi>That the nearer the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom is, the more profeſſors ſlumber and ſleep.</hi> This our Lord foreſaw and foretold of theſe laſt times. And what is the meaning of al thoſe <hi>awakening Jugements,</hi> which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent al the European Churches are fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but to ſtartle ſlumbering profeſſors, out of their ſweet ſleeps of carnal ſecuritie? And yet, Lo! to this very day, how do the moſt of profeſſors, ſlumber, if not ſleep on their beds of carnal ſecuritie? Doth not the Lord, as it were force open the eyes, and break in with awakening Jugements on his Churches day by day? Who knows how near that <hi>midnight-crie, Behold the Lord cometh, Mat. 25.6.</hi> may be? Is it not then mater of prodigious Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that Chriſtians, the main of whoſe profeſſion is, <hi>To wait for the coming of their Lord,</hi> ſhould be ſurpriſed with ſpiritual ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in a day of ſo great <hi>Danger</hi> and Dutie, when in al likelyhood ſome eminent Approche of their Lord, and as we have cauſe to fear in a way of Jugement, is ſo near?</p>
            <p>The contemplation of the forementioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, with ſome other conſiderations, is that which hath given <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Forme,</hi> to the following Diſcourſe; which is intended as a word in ſeaſon, to awaken <hi>ſecure profeſſors,</hi> and wind up their Spirits unto that, which is their higheſt concerne at al times, ſpecially in theſe evil Days, namely, <hi>A daily looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of the Day of
<pb facs="tcp:53798:4"/>God,</hi> in order to <hi>al holy converſation and Godlineſſe.</hi> And would Chriſtians but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider and meditate on the weight and force of this Argument, it cannot be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what ſweet and efficacious Influences it would derive on their Hearts and Lives. O! <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what Eminences, and Raiſures in Grace would they arrive? how viſible and glorious would their Graces be? How humble, and yet heavenly-minded would they be? What real, ſpiritual, deep, broad, ſublime, feeling and affective Notions of God would they have? What a plenitude and fulneſſe of Grace would poſſeſſe the Bent of their Wils? How would their Graces lend to each other their mutual Succur, and Aſſiſtance? Yea, what a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Graces ſeemingly oppoſite would there be found in them; did they daily look for and haſten unto the coming of their Lord?</p>
            <p>A Believer, that lives under the power and Influence of this frame, at what a diſtance from ſin doth he keep? How much is his heart Crucified to al the Glorie of this fading world? Doth he not daily die unto al ſelf-confidences in Grace received? Is not Chriſt placed in the room of ſelf? O! what generous and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime thoughts of Chriſt has he? Who ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his Eye, as Chriſt? and thence, who ſo precious in Chriſts eye, as he? How much doth ſuch a ſoul thirſt after the moſt intimate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion with Chriſt? Who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues Adoption, pardon of ſin, and peace of Conſcience more than he? O! what a tender feeling conſcience has he? Doth not the leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:53798:4"/>ſin burden, and pinch him more, than the greateſt ſufferings? What an exact ſcrutinie and examen doth he bring his heart and life daily under? How much is his heart broken for, and broken off from ſin day by day? Is it not his greateſt grief, that he ſhould ſo much, and ſo oft grieve the Spirit of God? Doth he not daily judge and condemne himſelf, that ſo he may not be judged and condemned of the Lord at the laſt day? O! What a profound abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpirit, and humble ſilence before the Divine Majeſtie doth he lie under? How bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and loathſome is ſin to him, becauſe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits him for his Lords companie? How little can he be frowned out of Dutie, or flattered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin? Its true, he is meek, modeſt, and patient in his own cauſe; but O! how fervent and warme is his zele in the cauſe of God? What ſtrength and force doth his zele gain by oppoſition? Who more active and vigorous in the exercice of Grace, than he? There is no exercice of Grace ſo difficult, but it is made facile and eaſy to ſuch a ſoul, as daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects his Lords Approche. Hath not Grace in ſuch a ſoul its perfect worke, ſo that it ſerves for al uſes; and performes al the Acts, to which it hath a power? What is it that makes Chriſtians ſo dead and barren as to gracious exercices, but the putting off the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Lord? O! what univerſal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, hearts flexible to every command, have ſuch, as daily look for the coming of their Lord? How unwilling are ſuch to omit any wil of God, or commit any wil of the fleſh?
<pb facs="tcp:53798:5"/>How much of an Heavenly converſation have they in their way to Heaven? What an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for, and Vindication of their profeſſion do they give, by a ſhining exemplarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? How eaſie and familiar is Chriſts Yoke and Croſſe unto them? What a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the life of Chriſt do they give in their lives?</p>
            <p>Theſe, with many others, are the Influences, which! an awakened believing ſoul receives from a ſerious looking for, and haſtening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coming of the Day of God. And O that Chriſtians would put this rare experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the trial! What ſtrange Alterations would they find in their Hearts and Lives? How would they hereby adorne their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? How ſoon would that Reproche, with which profeſſors are now laden, be removed? If this following Diſcourſe may any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to theſe great ends, al that is further deſired is, that the Glorie of al may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto our great Lord, who alone can make every Truth efficacious and operative.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53798:10"/>of the ſecond coming of their Lord. The Chapter has two parts: (1.) A confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſts ſecond coming to Juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: (2.) An elegant deſcription of the ſame, with the worlds deſtruction. In the firſt part there are theſe members, (1.) A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Atheiſtic, Epicurean</hi> ſcoffers, who ſhould ariſe in theſe laſt days, <hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 3. (2.) A <hi>Recitation</hi> of their Argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould endeavor to ſubvert the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt and future Judgement, <hi>v.</hi> 4. (3.) The Refutation of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. (4.) A confirmation of the Worlds diſſolution by fire, <hi>v.</hi> 7. (5.) A proleptic excuſe for the delay thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. In the ſecond part of the Chapt. you have, (1.) A deſcription of Chriſts coming to Jugement; both from the manner of it, which would be moſt ſudden and unexpected by many; and from its Adjunct, namely the Worlds laſt Conflagration: which is expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in its parts, <hi>v.</hi> 10. (2.) An exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to al <hi>manner of holy Converſation</hi> and <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> drawen from the manner of Chriſts coming, and the Worlds diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. (3.) A promiſſe of New Heavens, and New Earth, <hi>v.</hi> 13. (4.) A Repetition of his exhortation to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and a confirmation of the ſame from <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So much for the coherence in general.</p>
                  <p>The Text is a Deſcription of our Lords ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming to Jugement, both with the <hi>Manner,</hi> and <hi>Adjuncts</hi> thereof; and thence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53798:10"/>an Exhortation to al manner of holy Converſation and Godlineſſe. In the verſe immediately precedent, the Apoſtle makes mention of Gods <hi>Longanimitie,</hi> or <hi>Long-ſufferance.</hi> But leſt any ſhould abuſe this Divine Long-ſufferance to carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, he ſubjoins in our Text, v. 10. <hi>But the day of the Lord wil come as a thief in the night,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>The,</hi> is very <hi>emphatic</hi> and <hi>diſtinctive.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the Lord.] Why is it called the day of the Lord?</hi> (1.) By reaſon of its <hi>excellence,</hi> and <hi>magnificence:</hi> For things moſt excellent, and ſurpaſſing, are, by the Hebrews, in a more ſpecial manner attributed to God: as <hi>the fire of God,</hi> the <hi>Ceders of God,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) Becauſe this wil be the laſt Day of Time, which puts a period to Chriſts Mediatory Kingdome, and uſhers in Eternitie. (3.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this day our great Lord wil manifeſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53798:11"/>his <hi>Omnipotence, Faithfulneſſe Juſtice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, Wiſdome,</hi> with his other glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, which now ſeem veiled, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er luſtre, and Majeſtie. (4.) It ſeems to be called the <hi>Lords day,</hi> in oppoſition <hi>to mans day</hi> in this life. The wicked have their Day of Sin; ay, but the Lord wil alſo have his day of Jugement: The Enemies of Chriſt have their day of perſecution; ay, but wil not the Lord have his day of vengeance alſo? Cloſe hypocrites have their day of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic profeſſion; and the Lord wil have his day of manifeſtation and diſcovery: Afflicted Saints have their day of ſuffering; but the Lord wil have alſo his day of recompence, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6, 7, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wil come as a thief in the night.]</hi> Our Apoſtle hath taken this Reſſemblance from the mouth of our Lord, Mat. 24.43. <hi>But know this, that if the good man of the houſe had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.39. The ſame ſimilitude is uſed, to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.2. <hi>The Day of the Lord ſo cometh as a thief in the night.</hi> The like <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.15. But <hi>why is the coming of our Lord thus expreſſed, under</hi> the <hi>ſimilitude of a Thief's coming?</hi> Becauſe, (1.) The coming of a thief is unexpected and uncertain: he uſually ſurpriſeth thoſe in the houſe, when they leaſt expect him: So the coming of our Lord ſhal he, when ſecure ſinners leaſt expect him. (2.) The coming of a thief is uſually ſwift and ſpeedy: The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53798:11"/>leſſe he is expected, the more ſpeed he makes: though the whole familie be aſleep; yet he ſleeps not, but is vigilant, and active in his courſe and motion: So our Lord, his coming is not leſſe ſpeedy, than unexpected. Though ſinners may ſleep on the bed of carnal eaſe and ſecuritie; yet he ſleeps not, but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding quick and ſwift in his motion. So Mat. 24.27. <hi>For as the lightening cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt; ſo ſhal alſo the coming of the Son of man be.</hi> (3.) A Thief comes to rob and make ſpoil; yea oft to kil: So our Lords coming is in order to vengeance, on the ſecure unbelieving World: Thus Luke 21.34, 35. <hi>ſo that day come on you unawares: for as a ſnare ſhal it come on al them that dwel on the face of the whole earth.</hi>

                  <p>This Queſtion may be reſolved into two parts? (1.) <hi>What it is to look for the coming of the day of God?</hi> (2.) <hi>What it is to haſten to coming of the day of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What it is to look for the coming of the day of God?</hi> This <hi>notion, to look for,</hi> being a metaphor borrowed from natural viſion or ſight, we may refer the Reſolution of the Queſtion to the ſeveral parts of <hi>natural vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> Which implies, (1.) A <hi>Viſive facultie</hi> or <hi>eye,</hi> whereby we ſee: (2.) An <hi>object vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> or <hi>thing ſeen:</hi> (3.) A <hi>medium,</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53798:18"/>through which we ſee. (4.) The actual <hi>Reception</hi> of the Object into the eye. Thus in the looking for the coming of our Lord, There muſt be a <hi>ſpiritual eye;</hi> an <hi>object vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;</hi> a <hi>medium; and the Reception of the object into the eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There muſt be a ſpiritual eye or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied viſive facultie, to look for the coming of the day of God: Without a ſanctified mind there can be no looking for the coming of the day of God; A blind man may as wel look on the Sun, as a carnal mind look for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord. Now this ſpiritual eye, or ſanctified mind, which is ſo eſſential to our looking for the coming of our Lord, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth ſeveral Divine <hi>Qualities,</hi> or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) It muſt be an <hi>Evangelic fiducial</hi> eye; not merely <hi>rational,</hi> or <hi>legal.</hi> To look for the coming of our Lord, merely with an eye of Reaſon, is but to put it farther off from us: The coming of our Lord is an object altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inviſible to an eye of reaſon: it's faith alone can make it viſible and evident. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. Faith is ſaid to be the <hi>Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> i. e, The coming of our Lord, and al thoſe good things hoped for at his coming, are altogether inevident and inviſible to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eye, yet viſible and evident to an eye of faith. Neither muſt it be a <hi>legal eye;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we expect the coming of our Lord. A le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal eye looks only on the black and terrible part of the day of God, and therefore never haſtens the ſoul towards it. A legal terrified
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53798:19"/>eye flies from the coming of our Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17; but an Evangelic eye poſteth towards it. A legal eye breeds horrors and affrightments; but an evangelic eye love to, and delight in this great day.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) It muſt be a <hi>ſingle eye.</hi> The coming of our Lord is an object very glorious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; therefore if the eye of the mind, that looks towards it, be not ſingle, it can never reach that day. Our great Lord informes us, Mat. 6.22.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.22, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>The light of the bodie is the eye: if therefore thine eye be ſingle, thy whole bodie, ſhal be ful of light.</hi> 23. <hi>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole bodie ſhal be ful of darkneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. A ſingle eye in nature implies a ſingle <hi>object,</hi> and a ſingle <hi>medium:</hi> if either of theſe be double, the viſion or ſight is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo <hi>evil.</hi> A <hi>ſingle eye,</hi> as to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, implies a <hi>ſingle regard</hi> to that great day, as the ſupreme meſure of althings, both good and evil. Oppoſite hereto is a <hi>double eye,</hi> here ſtiled an <hi>evil eye;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an idoliſing regard to, and admiration of the poor fading emty goods of this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior world; whereby our looking to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord is obſtructed. As in nature, the eyeing of a double <hi>object,</hi> ſpecially if the objects are oppoſite, diſtracts the ſight: ſo here, he that ſtands gazing and poring on the heart-alluring Idols of this lower world, is in no capacitie to look for the coming of his Lord.<note place="margin">Jam. 1.8.</note> So <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.8. <hi>A double-minded man is inſtable in al his ways.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a man that has a double eye or <hi>mind,</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53798:19"/>one for the <hi>World,</hi> and another for Chriſt. Such an eye is alwaies inſtable; becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and torne in pieces, between two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Objects: Now and then he looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, ſpecially when convictions of ſin prevail; and then again towards the world, when luſt prevails. He that wil look ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly towards the coming of his Lord muſt have a ſingle eye or regard thereto.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) It muſt be a <hi>pure Eye,</hi> i. e. a mind free from prevalent mixtures of ſin. In nature, if the eye be affected with any viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humor or qualitie, the ſight is obſtructed or corrupted. As for inſtance in the <hi>Yellow Jaundice,</hi> the eye being affected with a bilous yellow humor, althings ſeem yellow: ſo here, if the eye of the mind be affected with any vitious carnal humor or beloved luſt, the coming of our Lord, and al other ſpiritual objects, wil be but <hi>carnally</hi> apprehended. For every thing is received according to the qualitie and condition of the recipient: A carnal mind receiveth things ſpiritual car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; as a ſpiritual mind things carnal ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. Look as drunken men, having their optic nerves, and thence their ſight diſtorted and obſtructed by fumes and vapors, aſcending from their ſtomachs, can ſee nothing diſtinctly; juſt ſo is it with carnal minds diſtorted, and obſtructed by the vapors of luſt from the heart, they cannot look diſtinctly to the coming of their Lord. It is the pure incorrupted mind only that ſees diſtinctly and evidently the coming of his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53798:20"/>Lord.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.8.</note> So Mat. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhal ſee God.</hi> By the <hi>pure in heart,</hi> we muſt underſtand the pure mind, which alone can contemplate God and Chriſt in his ſecond coming. Hence the eyes of the Church are compared,<note place="margin">Cant. 7.4.</note> Cant. 7.4. <hi>To the Fiſhpools in Heſhbon;</hi> which denotes the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of her mind: For the Fiſhpools in <hi>Heſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> as the learned obſerve, were famous for their puritie, being <hi>Cryſtalline,</hi> without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mud, or terrene mater: ſuch muſt the puritie of our minds be, in order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the coming of our Lord. The more pure the eye is, the more clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct is the ſight: A pure eye ſees more things and more of every thing, than a vitiated eye doth. Such muſt be the puritie of the mind, that wil look for the coming of our Lord. Not but that the pureſt mind on this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has ſome mixture of ſin in it: only, if ſin do not incorporate with the ſpirit of the mind; and if it be not prevalent, the mind may, in evangelic eſtimation, be accounted pure. As melted gold is eſtimed pure, albeit ſome droſſe adhere to it, if it incorporate not with the gold: or boiled liquors are reputed pure, albeit ſome ſcum ſwim on the top: ſo the mind may be judged pure, albeit ſome ſcum or droſſe of luſt ſwim thereon, if it do not, in a prevalent degree, incorporate with the ſpirit of the mind, its ſupreme part.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) It muſt be a <hi>ſound, ſtrong, firme eye,</hi> not weak and feeble. Bright and dazling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, alſo ſuch as are very remote, require a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53798:20"/>ſound and ſtrong eye to behold them: a weak feeble eye is not fit to behold the Sun, or things greatly diſtant. Now the coming of our Lord is a mighty glorious dazling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; alſo, very remote and diſtant from ſenſe and reaſon: how is it poſſible then that any ſhould look towards it, without a ſtrong ſound mind, and firme eye of faith?<note place="margin">Prov. 2.7.

Tentations and trials are the Schole of Chriſt; where Chriſtians gain a feeling knowlege of Chriſt: yea more in a day, than by Books in many years. Thus <hi>Rivet,</hi> under dying torments: <q>I have, ſaith he, learned more Divinitie in ten days, that thou haſt viſited me, than in fivety years before.

The firſt coming of our Lord was in the <hi>forme of a Servant,</hi> in a mean abaſed manner, without that pompe and ſtate,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53798:26"/>which was due to his glorious perſon: Ay, but his ſecond coming ſhal be in another-gets manner, ſuch as becomes the Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. So Mat. 16.27. <hi>For the Son of man ſhal come in the glorie of his father, with his Angels.</hi> The like Mat. 25.31. <hi>When the Son of man ſhal come in his Glorie, and al the Angels with him, then ſhal he ſit upon the throne, of his Glorie.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.16. <hi>For the Lord himſelf ſhal deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, and with the trumpe of God.</hi> O What a glorious Apparence wil this be? how wil the whole World in a moment ring with this ſhout? What a dazling raviſhing luſtre wil ſhine from Chriſt, and al his retinue? Hence <hi>to look for the coming of the day of God,</hi> is to have a conſtant, great regard to that Glorie and Majeſtie, which wil attend this apparence of Chriſt.

The ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this glorious apparence wil come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration in our laſt Queſtion. In the general, The ſecond coming of Chriſt wil be the moſt glorious object that ever eye beheld; and a ſpiritual believing eye, fixed on the coming of the day of God as moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſees a glorie in al things that refer to that day: a glorie in Grace; a glorie in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances;

What a glorie doth that great day, and the forethoughts of it, infuſe into althings that belong to Chriſt? And, on the contrarie, how doth the ſpiritual ſight of this glorious day darken al the Glorie and beautie of this lower world? What a fading Sun-burnt flour are althings below, to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, that has his eye of faith fixed on this great and glorious day?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) To look for the coming of the day of God implies, a ſpiritual conſtant regard to it, as the <hi>meſure of al Good and Evil;</hi> to look on nothing as real happineſſe or miſerie, but what wil be ſuch at the coming of our Lord. He that looks for that great day, wil look on nothing here below as great. He that looks up for the coming of the day of God, wil look down on althings of time, as emtie, poor, and fading. None looks for the coming of the day of God as he ought, but he that meſures althings by it; he who deſires creature-comforts, not for enjoyment, but for uſe; and when he hath them doth uſe them aright, not as fuel for his luſt; but as <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives,</hi> to fit him for the day of God.

                     <hi>to lead captive, with triumph.</hi> The ſenſe is: I combat dayly with my bodie, to bring it into ſubjection, that ſo I might meet my Lord with triumph, and comfort. Such was <hi>Paul</hi>'s regard to the coming of the day of God: He prepared his bodie, and mind, by al manner of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian exercices: he made the coming of his Lord the meſure of al inferior goods: he looked on al he had as given by Chriſt, and ſo was ready to give back al to Chriſt, when he called for it: what he had he improved
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53798:28"/>for Chriſt, and what he had not he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly wanted: He knew how to abound in his wants, and how to want in his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. He could be diligent in the uſe of earthly comforts, and yet dead to them: He was better pleaſed in his mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, than worldlings are in the higheſt: He purſued after a world to come, and that made him contemne the preſent: His eye was fixed on the coming of his Lord, and that took him off from admiring any good things of time. Thus <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſo muſt we make the coming of the day of God, the meſure of althings. So much for the coming of the day of God conſidered in itſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we conſider the coming of the day of God in its <hi>Adjuncts,</hi> then to look for it implies, (1.) To look on it as <hi>near.</hi> Things remote affect but little: the nearer an object, is, if it greatly concerneth us, the more it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Now there is a twofold nearneſſe, under which we are to look for the coming of the day of God: Firſt the nearneſſe of its approche to us: and Secondly, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our approche to it. (1.) We are to look for the coming of the day of God in the <hi>nearneſſe</hi> of its <hi>Approche to us.</hi> This has ever been the great ſin of the ſecure world, that men look on the coming of the day of God as a thing remote. Yea, our Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> foretold, that this would be the great ſin of theſe <hi>laſt days:</hi> ſo in ſome few verſes before our Text, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>knowing this firſt, that there ſhal come in the laſt days ſcoffers,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53798:29"/>walking after their own luſts; and ſaying, where is the promiſſe of his coming?</hi> &amp;c. And this prodigious piece of <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> preſageth would befal theſe laſt days, ſeems to have given the original occaſion of the following diſcourſe, touching the ſecond coming of our Lord: Yea, and that which is yet more remarquable is this, that the nearer the day approcheth, the more remote ſecure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by their unbelief, make it to be. Thence <hi>Peter</hi> dwels much on this argument, that the day of Chriſts coming is near. So v. 9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſſe.</hi> Again v. 11. <hi>Seing al theſe things ſhal be</hi> [Greek. are] <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</hi> &amp;c. He ſpeakes in the preſent tenſe, to ſhew the nearneſſe of this day. So that to look for the coming of the day of God, is to look on it as <hi>near</hi> to us. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4.5. <hi>The Lord is at hand.</hi> And Hebr. 10.37. <hi>For yet a little while, and he that ſhal come, wil come, and wil not tarrie.</hi> The like Jam. 5.9. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Judge ſtandeth at the dore.</hi> And if thoſe primitive Saints looked on the coming of the day of God as near, how much nearer then ought we to look on it? Oh! with what ſwift wings doth it poſt towards us? How ſoon wil winged time ruſh hinto Eternitie? The laſt words that ever Chriſt ſpake, or wil ſpeak to the end of the world, in a way of Goſpel Adminiſtration, were to aſſure us that he would come quickly, Rev. 22.20. <hi>He which teſtifieth theſe things, ſaith, ſurely, I come quickly, Amen.</hi> This Amen is a ſeal for <hi>ratification,</hi> and <hi>confirmation,</hi> to aſſure us,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53798:29"/>that our Lord wil <hi>quickly come.</hi> Lo! do not the Heavens begin to open, and make way for the coming of the Lord of Glorie? May we not, by a ſpiritual eye of faith, ſee him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the clouds? May not a gracious heart hear the laſt Trumpe ringing in its ears? Is not that fire already kindled, which ere long wil turne the whole globe of Heaven and Earth into flames? Is not the Judge of quick and dead at the dore? And ought we not then to look on the coming of the day of God as near?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) We are to look on the coming of the day of God as near, in regard of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche to it, by Death. Though the coming of this day ſhould be never ſo remote, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the laſt jugement, yet it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that our approche to it by death is moſt near. Alas! who knows how ſoon any of us may behold our particular day of jugement ſtaring us in the face? Do we not al begin to die, aſſoon as we begin to live? Is not death as <hi>eſſential</hi> to us as life? What is our preſent life but a coming into, and going out of this world? What is this preſent earthly Tabernacle we live in, but our Inne, our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, our Leper-houſe? How ſoon wil a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time eat us out of our poſſeſſion? Doth it not then nearly concerne us to look dayly for death? And is not this a main part of our looking for the coming of the day of God? This was <hi>Pauls</hi> frame, Phil. 1.23.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> 
                     <hi>For I am in a ſtrait betwixt two, having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53798:30"/>better. To depart,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> contains various emphatic notions proper to the ſenſe. It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies (1.) To looſen or relinquiſh our chains, as priſoners. (2.) To depart from our Inne, to our home. (3.) To weigh anchor, and ſet ſail. (4.) To looſen the cords of our Tents as Soldiers. (5.) To be reſolved into our firſt elements, as bodies corrupted. So that <hi>Pauls</hi> longing deſire was to depart from his bodie, as his priſon, his Inne, his Tent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why? <hi>That he might be with Chriſt.</hi> This made him ſo willing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that ſo he might be taken into a more intimate union with his Lord, for whoſe coming he ſo much looked. He looked on the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of his bodie to be but the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> of his ſoul with Chriſt: Death was in his eye but a dore to life: He knew death would take nothing from him but his <hi>priſon,</hi> his <hi>chain,</hi> his <hi>clog,</hi> his <hi>ſhame,</hi> his <hi>ſting,</hi> his <hi>poiſon,</hi> his <hi>burden,</hi> his <hi>miſerie.</hi> This made him to look for the day of death, as the day of his eſpouſals and coronation. So that it's evident, to look for the coming of the day of God implies our looking for death, which is a great approche thereto. And may we not take up this as a general obſervation, that none have more lively expectations of the coming of their Lord, than thoſe who have moſt freſh and affectionate expectations of death? And on the contrary, do not they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes put far from them the coming of the day of God, who put far from them thoughts of death? ſuch an eſſential and intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53798:30"/>is there between theſe two. Ah! think how ſoon your breath wil grow cold, your eye ſtrings break, your ſoul ſtand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the dores of your lips, and take flight at the windows of your eyes; and then you cannot but look for the coming of your Lord. Doth not the frailtie of life, ſpecially in theſe days, engage us to look for death? And are any more fit to live, than thoſe who think moſt of and prepare for dying? Should we not whiles on earth ſo live, as alwaies dying; that ſo we may, when death comes, live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with our Lord? Is not life and death the ſame thing to him, that daily lives in the expectation of, and preparation for death? Oh! then why ſhould we not ever live in the expectation of death, which wil join our ſoul, and Chriſt together?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Another Adjunct of the coming of the day of God is its <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexpectedneſſe.</hi> This is fully expreſſed, 2 Pet. 3.10. <hi>But the day of the Lord wil come as a thief in the night.</hi> We al know the coming of a thief is unexpected: yea the nearer he is, the leſſe uſually he is expected. Such wil be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord, as he himſelf informes us, Luke 12.39, 40. <hi>If the good man of the houſe had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched. Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ready alſo: For the Son of man cometh at an hour, when ye think not.</hi> We find this exemplified in the parable of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Mat. 25.6. <hi>And at midnight there was a crie made, Behold the Bridegroom cometh.</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53798:31"/>The Bridegrooms coming at midnight, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that our Lords coming ſhal be when leaſt expected: For men at midnight are uſually in their deepeſt ſleep. So then, to look for the coming of the day of God, is to look on it as that, which wil come when leaſt expected. Oh! what a ſurpriſe wil it be to ſlumbering virgins, to hear that <hi>midnight crie, behold the bridegroom cometh?</hi> Yea, how many wiſe Virgins wil be found ſlumbering, and ſo not expecting this great day? Is it not therefore the dutie of al, to look for the coming of the day of God, as that of a chief in the night, who cometh when leaſt expected.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may conſider the coming of the day of God in its <hi>Conſequents;</hi> which are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: but, at preſent, we ſhal mention only two, namely the <hi>final Jugement,</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:</hi> and in this regard;</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) To look for the coming of the day of God, implies a looking for the <hi>laſt Jugement.</hi> Oh! what a great day wil that be, when ſin ſhal no longer go maſqued, nor Godlineſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced: How wil Grace then ſhine forth in its own native glorie, and beautie? How wil al the fuel, with which men now feed their luſts, be then turned into fuel for Hel-fire, and ſtings of Conſcience? With what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable hunger and thirſt, wil the ſenſual glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and drunkard be then tormented? What a vexatious fire wil burne both bodie and ſoul of the laſcivious unclean wretch? Wil not every luſt then have its proper torment? ſhal not the ſecure Conſcience then be filled with

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53798:34"/> (1.) One great act of faith, in the actual reception of, or looking for the coming of the day of God, is, to <hi>realiſe that great Day.</hi> The more real our notions are, the more <hi>affective</hi> and <hi>effective</hi> they are. There is a vaſt difference between the ſight of the Sun in the Firmament; and the ſight of it in a picture: the former is real, the later not: So in like manner, the difference is not leſſe, between the beholding of Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, as held forth by notions only, and the real view of it by faith. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worke of faith, to give the ſoul real views of things; Faith is the greateſt <hi>realiſer</hi> in the World: It can realiſe things moſt remote, as to ſenſe and reaſon: Things infinitely out of ſight, in regard of time, and natural exiſtence, faith makes them preſent, and ſo gives a real view of them. Al real ſight implies an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the object in the eye, agreable to the exiſtence it has in it ſelf: So real know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege denotes a real being of the object known, in the mind of him that knows it. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is really apprehended, unleſſe the real Idea or image of the thing it ſelf be in the mind of him that apprehends it. This is moſt true here, unleſſe the coming of the day of God be really exiſtent in the eye of faith, we do not look for it. This indeed is one of the greateſt myſteries of faith, that it can <hi>realiſe</hi> things moſt remote, even the coming of the day of God. Al reading, hearing, ſtudying, meditation, and diſcourſing wil not diſcover to us the coming of our Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

The Scholes give us a good diſtinction, between <hi>Abſtract,</hi> and <hi>Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> knowlege: Abſtract knowlege is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of things in their notions, pictures, or propoſitions only: but <hi>Intuitive</hi> knowlege is the contemplation of things as they exiſt in themſelves. Such an <hi>Intuitive,</hi> though reflexe, ſight doth faith give us of the day of God, by realiſing of it to the ſoul.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> So Heb. 11.1. <hi>Faith, is the ſubſtance of things hoped for.</hi>

O! What a miraculous efficace hath faith, to make things abſent preſent; things hoped for actually exiſtent? And doth not a main part of our looking for the coming of our Lord conſiſt herein? could we but by faith <hi>realiſe</hi> that great day, what lively, intuitive, heart-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing views ſhould we have of it? how would our hearts be raviſht in the previſion, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of it?

But, ah! here lies the bane of our profeſſion, we content our ſelves with ſome <hi>notional</hi> ſpeculations, and contemplations of that glorious day, without that real <hi>intuitive</hi> view thereof; which faith gives.

Wil he not ere long come from Heaven? and ſhould we not, by al manner of Heavenly thoughts and Aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, go forth to meet him day by day? ought we not every hour to ſend forth holy ejacultions to meet our Lord? Whatever you are about, you ought to have the coming of your Lord before your eyes. Are you plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and contriving about your worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? Why be ſure you loſe not the thoughts of your Lords coming. Are you in a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? let the thoughts of your Lords coming be your companion. Let your firſt and laſt thoughts every day converſe with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord. Entertain your hearts frequently with ſuch ſacred <hi>Soliloquies</hi> as theſe: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I hear the laſt trumpe ever ſounding in mine ears: Methinkes, I ſee my Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus coming in the clouds, with ten thouſands
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53798:37"/>of his Angels. Thus we ought <hi>to familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe</hi> the coming of the day of God. And that more particularly, (1) By holy <hi>ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations?</hi> O! what frequent ejaculations ought we to ſend forth, towards the coming of our Lord? One ſaving glance towards this day brings life to the ſoul. But oh! what familiar converſe have they with this great day, who dayly ſend forth multitudes of ejaculations towards it? what an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation is this? (2.) We muſt <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliariſe</hi> the coming of the day of God by fixed <hi>contemplation</hi> on it. There muſt be a dwelling of the thoughts on that day, by ſtated and fixed meditation every day. The more our thoughts dwel on this day at ſtated ſeaſons, the more familiar it wil be to us.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Actually to look for the coming of the day of God implies further, dayly <hi>to wait for it,</hi> to ſtand on our watch tower, and thence always to expect it. This we find oft inculcated by our Lord, and his Apoſtles. Thus Luke 12.35. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 36. <hi>And ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord, when he wil returne from the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. having mentioned in the precedent verſes, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners and ſignes of his coming, he addes: <hi>and when theſe things begin to come to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53798:38"/>paſſe, then look, and lift up your heads, for your Redemtion draweth nigh.</hi> Albeit this ſeems limited to ſome time immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foregoing the coming of Chriſt, yet it may, by a paritie of reaſon, be extended more generally, to our waiting for Chriſts coming at al times. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it a proprietie of Saints to <hi>wait for their Adoption,</hi> namely at the coming of Chriſt. Yea, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Paul</hi> makes this one of the firſt frames they arrived unto, after converſion, <hi>To wait for his Son from Heaven.</hi> Now this waiting for the coming of the day of God implies, dayly to revive and refreſh our thoughts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of that day: not to give way to any ſhort ſlumbers, much leſſe to deep ſleeps; but to be always in exſpectation of that great day. This is the great faut of the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as wel as the fooliſh, they are ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with fits of ſlumber; which are oppoſite to waiting for the coming of our Lord. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.5. O! what a world of ſuch ſlumbering Virgins are there?</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Actually to look for the coming of the day of God imports farther, to get a <hi>Prepoſſeſſion</hi> of that day, and thoſe good things hoped for, therein to be enjoyed. The eye, by looking on the Sun, gets a poſſeſſion of it: yea, there are certain Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Glaſſes, which give the eye the real Image and poſſeſſion of Objects very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. So, by looking on the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53798:38"/>of Chriſt, and thoſe good things hoped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or, in that day, by an eye of faith, through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Optic glaſſe of the promiſſe, we come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o poſſeſſe the ſame. So Mat. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart; for they ſhal ſee God,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. e. <hi>poſſeſſe and enjoy God.</hi> Thus, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the coming of Chriſt, you poſſeſſe him. This ſpiritual viſion of faith gives <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Fruition.</hi> Yea, in natural contemplation, the mind, by gazing on its object, gets the poſſeſſion of it: and ſo the mind by underſtanding becomes althings. This holds much more true in <hi>ſpirituals;</hi> ſuch, as by faith gaze much on the ſecond coming of the day of God, thereby really poſſeſſe the ſame. Look on Chriſt by faith and you poſſeſſe him.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Actually to look for the ſecond coming of our Lord, implies thus much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to get the ſoul <hi>transformed into the image of Chriſt:</hi> Al ſaving views of Chriſt, whether as paſt or to come, do transforme the heart into the image of Chriſt. Whiles, by the eye of faith, we look on Chriſt, in his ſecond glorious coming, a little image of Chriſt is ſtamped on faiths eye. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. As take a looking-glaſſe, and expoſe it oppoſite to the Sun, and it wil have an Image of the Sun ſtamped on it; yea, it wil ſhine, in imitation of the Sun: So, ſuch as contemplate the face of Chriſt, in his glorious appearance, wil have a little image of Chriſt ſtamped on the face of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53798:39"/>their ſouls. This was typified by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s face, when he had ſeen God. Look on Chriſt by faith, and live in, and to Chriſt: look on Chriſt, and love Chriſt: look on Chriſt and be humble, as Chriſt was: look on Chriſt, and be crucified to the World, as Chriſt was: Look on Chriſt, and be patient as he was: Look on Chriſt, and thou wilt, in thy meſure, ſhine with Grace, as Chriſt ſhined Such a miraculous influence has our looking on Chriſts ſecond coming by faith, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the heart and life into the image of Chriſt. So much for the firſt branch of the Queſtion? <hi>What it is to look for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day of God?</hi>

This ariſeth from the natural difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſouls <hi>ſeeing,</hi> or <hi>knowing,</hi> and <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> things: for in ſeeing or <hi>knowing</hi> the object is by its Idea, or Image received into the ſoul: but in <hi>willing and affecting</hi> things the ſouls goes forth to meet, and adhere to its object. So that this haſtening to the coming of the day of God conſiſts in the <hi>Egreſſe,</hi> or going forth of the ſoul, by <hi>Wil, Affections,</hi> and al <hi>ſpiritual exercices</hi> of Grace, to meet our approaching Lord.</p>

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:53798:40"/> 1. To haſten to the coming of the day of God implies a firme, inviolable, vehement <hi>Bent</hi> of Wil towards that Day. So much as there is of a bended wil towards the coming of our Lord, ſo much doth the ſoul haſten thereto. O! how tenacious and invincible ſhould the wil be, in adhering to the coming of the day of God? This ſeems included in that exhortation of <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 11.23.</note> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. where he exhorts them, <hi>with purpoſe of heart, to cleave unto the Lord.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with a fixed, determined, reſolute <hi>Bent</hi> of wil, to adhere to the Lord, both in his preſent diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and approching glorious apparence. The force and efficace of this <hi>bended</hi> wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the deliberate <hi>Intention,</hi> or <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereof, towards that great day: when the ſoul doth, with a <hi>plenitude,</hi> or fulneſſe of Wil, adhere to our approching Lord. Now this ſtrong bent of wil procedes from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Adopption,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires and infuſeth into the wil a Divine Love; which is as a <hi>pondus,</hi> or weight to incline it towards the coming of the day of God. Hence we find this haſtening to the day of God expreſſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> by love thereto, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. where he ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.8.</note>

Love the day of God, and you haſten to it, yea live in it. So Can. 8.6. <hi>Set me as a ſeal on thine heart, as a ſeal upon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53798:40"/>thine arme; for love is ſtrong as death— it hath a moſt vehement flame,</hi> &amp;c. By love the heart aſcends up, as in a flame, to meet our Lord. Love is a ſwift poſt, that carries the heart to its beloved: It is never ſatisfied, 'til it arrives to <hi>union,</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> of what it loves. Abſence fires love, and makes it burne with a vehement flame towards its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching Lord. Yea, it gathers force from obſtructions, and difficulties. Love burning in the Intention of the wil gives ſwift feet, yea wings to the ſoul, to flie towards the coming of the day of God. A ſoul inſpired with love to our approching Lord, is not its own, but loſeth it ſelf in the boſome of its Lord; There it <hi>lives,</hi> and <hi>breathes,</hi> and <hi>moves</hi> day by day. Love is moſt <hi>artificial,</hi> and <hi>puiſſant</hi> to haſten the ſoul towards the day of God: it commands al the Paſſions and Actions of the ſoul to tend, and move this way: Yea, it makes the moſt difficult unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant way eaſy and pleaſant. Alas! do but thinke what love wil do, to meet and enjoy an abſent friend: and wil it not do much more to meet and enjoy its abſent Lord? Love grows not faint or weary in its motion, towards our coming Lord. Yea, it multiplies by acting, and that from the ſimilitude there is between the lover, and beloved. Hence there is no Grace, that has ſuch a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to its act and object as this Divine Love. Indeed, its never wel pleaſed longer than it is haſtening to its beloved: It imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately delivers up the heart to its approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53798:41"/>Lord, and ſo adheres to him by an unio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of ſpirit: It is impatient til it come to take hold of its Lord: it melts and diſſolves the heart into him. Such is the force of Love, in haſtening to the coming of the day o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The ſoul haſtens to the coming of the day of God, by longing <hi>deſires</hi> after it. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are the firſtborne of Love, and the feet of the ſoul, whereby it moves towards its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. He that is poſſeſt with deſires after the coming of Chriſt, cannot but haſten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that great day: For deſire is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry greedy Affection, which thinkes it has never enough of what it deſires. In every lover there is a deſire of union with its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: and therefore the abſence of Chriſt cauſeth the ſoul to breath forth <hi>love-ſighs</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſecond coming. Thus the Spouſe Cant. 8.14.<note place="margin">Cant. 8.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Make haſte</hi> [or <hi>flee away</hi>] <hi>my beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, or to a young hart, upon the mountains of Spices. Flie my beloved:</hi> As the Spouſe began with deſires of Chriſts firſt coming, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. to <hi>kiſſe</hi> her by the Preaching of his Goſpel; ſo ſhe ends this her Song, with earneſt deſires of his ſecond coming, to put an end to al her miſeries. Thence it follows: <hi>And be thou like to a Roe:</hi> or, <hi>liken thy ſelf to a Roe,</hi> [i. e. <hi>be ſwift and make haſte to flie away</hi>] or, <hi>to a young hart on the mountains of Spices.</hi> Some conceive, that the Harts, which ſed on thoſe mountains of Spices, had a very <hi>aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> fragrant ſmel; and thence the Spouſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53798:41"/>here reſſembles her beloved to theſe, thereby to ſhew, how much her heart was raviſhed with the ſweet odors of his Grace; and how much ſhe longed for his ſecond coming. Thus the ſame Spouſe or Church, Rev. 22.17. <hi>And the ſpirit and the bride ſay come, and let him that heareth ſay come:</hi> and v. 20. <hi>even ſo come, Lord Jeſus.</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid: <hi>O time poſt away, and haſten the coming of my Lord: come Lord, come; for Love is tormented with delays.</hi> Thus ardent deſires after the coming of our Lord do much haſten the ſoul towards that day. A believers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual crie ſhould be: <hi>Lord come down to me or take me up to thee:</hi> His deſires after the coming of his Lord ſhould never ceaſe, 'til he be maſter of what he deſires. This was the language of <hi>Pauls</hi> groans, 2 Cor. 5.2. <hi>For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with our houſe, which is from Heaven. Pauls</hi> groans after his diſſolution were in order to the conjunction of his ſoul with Chriſt: and hereby he haſtened to the coming of his Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſoul haſtens to the coming of the day of God, by lively <hi>Hopes</hi> of that day. Hope is the neck ſtretched forth, or head lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, whereby the ſoul expects, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, its approching Lord. Hope, as the good Spies <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> propheſieth good things, in the greateſt difficulties. A fiducial hope ſtands on ſure ground, even the word and fidelitie of God, and therefore it wil not be ſoon ſhaken, though the pillars of Heaven

That great day, although it be moſt joyous to Saints, yet it wil be alſo moſt terrible to ſinners: And the terrors of this day, apprehended by faith leave an holy awe, and dread on believers themſelves. Oh! what holy Tremblements of heart have many awakened ſerious ſouls, at the apprehenſion of that terrible day? This ſeems to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Pauls</hi> Exhortation, 2 Cor. 5.10.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>For we muſt al appear before the Jugement ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. What follows? 11. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the terror of the Lord we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade men.</hi> As if he had ſaid: Oh, friends!

Have we not al cauſe to tremble, and ſtand in awe of this terrible day? For our part, <hi>knowing the terror of the Lord, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade men,</hi> to maintain an holy dread and fear of that tremendous day. This holy awe and fear of that great day is no way inconſiſtent with lively hopes, and affectionate deſires thereof: neither doth it at al impede or hinder our haſtening thereto. For this Godly fear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes from a <hi>Spirit of Adoption, faith,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and ſo keeps the ſoul in an holy awe, leſt it ſhould do any thing unworthy of that great day. Its true, ſervile carnal fear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes from Unbelief, and ſelf-love; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore drives men from the day of God, whiles
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53798:43"/>it ſeems to haſten them towards it: But this holy <hi>filial</hi> fear proceding from faith and love, always prepares for, and haſtens the ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the coming of the day of God. Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear is of a dul and lazy humor: it freezeth and bindes up the powers of the ſoul: but filial fear is warme and active; it greatly enlargeth the heart in its motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the coming of our Lord. Yea, holy <hi>fear,</hi> as wel as faith and hope, makes our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lord preſent, and ſo his ſecond coming preſent to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We haſten to the coming of the day of God, by <hi>ſatisfaction, complacence,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in that glorious day. This is not at al inconſiſtent with the former: For the Child may dread and fear the coming of his Father, as a Judge; and yet delight and joy therein as his Father: ſo here, a Child of God, dreads the coming of Chriſt as a Judge, and yet rejoyceth therein, as Chriſt is a Father and Husband. Yea, how oft hath the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, at the ſame time, the greateſt holy fear and awe, and yet the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and ſolace in the expectation of his approching Lord? Complacence and delight ariſe from the preſence of the object de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in: Faith makes the coming of our Lord preſent, and then the believing ſoul find joy and ſatisfaction therein. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> delighted in the firſt coming of our Lord: John 8.56. <hi>Your father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day: and he ſaw it and was glad.</hi> By faith he made the day preſent,

Such ſhould the believers joy be in the previſion and prelibation of our Lords ſecond coming. O! what rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of joy might we have herein? What an Heaven upon Earth might a Believer fetch hence? As Chriſts abſence is moſt bitter, ſo ought not the foreſight of his returne be moſt ſweet and joyous to his ſpouſe and friends? Oh! how ſweet is it, even to dream of Chriſt? The heart and the treaſure are ever together: <hi>Luke</hi> 12.34. If Chriſt be your treaſure, your heart wil be with him, and delight in him. We find this delight in the previſion of our Lords ſecond coming deſcribed to the life by the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 98.6—9.</note> Pſal. 98.6—9. <hi>With trumpets, and ſound of cornet make a joyful noiſe before the Lord, the King,</hi> &amp;c. 8. <hi>Let the flouds clap their hands: let the hils be joyful together.</hi> Have the flouds <hi>hands to clap?</hi> or, the hils a <hi>tongue</hi> to ſing joyfully? no: but theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions, are, by a figure called <hi>proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeia,</hi> attributed to theſe inanimate creatures, to excite us to rejoice in the coming of the day of God. So it follows, v. 9. <hi>Before the Lord for he cometh to judge the earth, &amp;c.</hi> The like we find, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.10, 11, 12, 13. Thus by complacence, and ſatisfaction in the approche of our Lord, we dayly haſten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that great day. For al joy is <hi>active</hi> and <hi>diffuſive:</hi> it is as oil to the wheels of the ſoul; ſpecially if our joy be ſpiritual.</p>

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53798:44"/> 6. We haſten to the coming of the day of God, by putting our hearts into a prepared poſture, and diſpoſition to meet, and welcome him, when ever he comes. Thus the Latin Gloſſe on our text: <hi>Haſtening,</hi> i. e. ſay they, <hi>by acting wel, that you may be ſuch, whom the Lord may come to ſave.</hi> And certain it is, the more prepared we are to entertain our Lord, when he comes, the more we haſten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that great day.<note place="margin">Luke 12.34—36.</note> Thus <hi>Luke</hi> 12.34, 35, 36. <hi>v.</hi> 34. He tels them: <hi>where your treaſure is, there wil your heart be alſo,</hi> i. e. if the treaſure be in him, the heart wil be with him, and alwaies waiting for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thence it follows: 35. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning:</hi> Its an alluſion to perſons waiting for the Bridegroom, or their Maſters coming, in the night: and thence they ſtood with their loins girded, and lights burning, ready to meet him. So it follows: 36. <hi>And ye your ſelves like unto men, that wait for their Lord, when he wil returne from the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</hi> Now this preparation for the coming of our Lord conſiſts in getting a ſtock of habitual grace, and keeping the ſoul in a vigilant poſture. Chriſtians ſhould aim at the higheſt raiſures of Grace, that ſo they may meet their Lord with triumph. Grace in vigor and power is the beſt preparative for the coming of our Lord. Much Grace wil give much acceptance and boldneſſe in that day.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53798:44"/>Every new degree of Grace is a ſtep towards the day of God. He that attains to a great meſure of Grace, gets up into the ſpirit and life of that great day.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We haſten to the coming of the day of God, by running our Chriſtian race, with al manner of holy activitie and <hi>exercice of Grace.</hi> Habitual Grace prepares us for the coming of our Lord; but gracious exercices, in our Chriſtian race, is a preſſing on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that day. A ſpirit of ſloth puts us greatly back, but exercices of Grace do much haſten us on towards the day of God. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry repetition of a gracious act gives us a lift forward towards that day. By how much the more active Grace is, by ſo much the more we preſſe on towards the coming of our Lord. The exercice of Grace gives light, and life to the ſoul, in its Chriſtian race. One exercice of Grace diſpoſeth the ſoul for another: and this for another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus, exercices of Grace are multiplied into thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, without pain; whereby the ſoul great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſtens towards the coming of the day of God. The bleſſed God rewards exercices of Grace, with farther Aſſiſtances of Grace; yet of mere Grace. The higheſt aſſimilation of the ſoul to God is by divine operations. Whatever condition we are in, there is ſome ſuitable Grace, which being ſuitably exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed doth haſten the ſoul towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord.

                  <p n="8">8. By entring into the enjoyments of the Day of God, we haſten towards that day.

                  <p>HAving diſpatcht the firſt Queſtion, we procede to the ſecond: <hi>What Influence the Looking for, and Haſtening to the coming of the day of God, has on al ſorts of perſons, to raiſe them up, to al manner of holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and Godlineſſe?</hi> We may range al ſorts of perſons, under theſe two commun Heads of <hi>Sinners</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> which divide the whole World.

                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:53798:47"/> 1. Serious looking for the coming of our Lod has no ſmal Influence on <hi>Sinners,</hi> or perſons unconverted. I know not a more powerful principle, or conſideration, to make ſecure ſinners ſerious, about <hi>ſoul-concernes,</hi> than lively thoughts, and expectations of the ſecond coming of our Lord, to Jugement. Alas! can we imagine that ſenſual ſinners would wallow, head and ears in Senſualitie as they do, had they, but now and then, ſome ſerious deep Apprehenſions of their Lords approche to Judge the world? Would the baſe-minded worldling be ſo <hi>coſtive</hi> and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of his Gold and Silver, did he conſider, that ere long it muſt al be burnt up? No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: mens Conſciences would flie in their faces, and be a continual torment to them, til they had parted with their beloved Idols, were they but under the power of ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts, touching the coming of their Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Serious thoughts of Chriſts ſecond coming to Jugement, hasa very prevalent Influence on ſecure ſinners, in order to the <hi>conviction of ſin.</hi> This is indeed the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle, and grand Inſtrument of al conviction of Sin, <hi>That our great Lord wil, ere long, come to judge the world:</hi> and the clearer apprehenſions men have of that great day, the clearer convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wil they have of ſin. If ſin be little i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53798:47"/>therefore has been the courſe, which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God in al ages have taken, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the ſecure World of ſin, namely, to ſet before them the coming of Chriſt to jugement. Thus <hi>Enoch;</hi> what was the ſubſtance of his propheſie, or preaching to that ſinful genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a lively deſcription of our Lords coming to judge the world? This is evident from Jude 14.15. <hi>And</hi> Enoch <hi>alſo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude 14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth from</hi> Adam, <hi>propheſied of theſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his Saints: To execute jugement upon al; and to convince al that are ungodly among them, of al their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed; and of al their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> O! what powerful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did <hi>Enoch</hi> preach, to that debauched ſinful age, touching the coming of our Lord to jugement? But alas! how few believed his report? Yea, what blaſphemous or hard ſpeeches did they utter againſt the Lord? But, addes <hi>Enoch, The Lord cometh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince al that are ungodly,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid: Alas! you wil not now be convinced of your ſin, by my Preaching: but know, that the Lord, when he cometh, wil convince you to purpoſe. This alſo, without dout, was a part of <hi>Noahs</hi> Sermons; who is ſaid to be 2 Pet. 2.5. <hi>a Preacher of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> i. e. one that endeavored to convince them of their ſin, and righteouſneſſe by Chriſt.

Here we have an <hi>Ironic conceſſion</hi> to a young man, going on in the heat of his luſts, and ſolacing himſelf in his youthful pleaſures. As if he had ſaid: <hi>Take thy fil of youthful delights; go on in thy purſuit after ſenſual enjoyments: and much good may they do thee.</hi> But then, (2.)

Would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners but conſider, that ere long our Lord wil come, and bring them into Juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for al their evil deeds, what awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Conſcience; what dreadful convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin would they ſoon fal under? But, Oh! here lies the hel of this ſecure world, men put far from them this evil day; and ſaym, at leaſty in their hearts, <hi>where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe of his coming?</hi> He that has ſpiritual, and ſtrong apprehenſions of the coming of his Lord, what diſtinct and evident convictions of ſin wil he have?

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21? How great wil ſmal ſins, even vain thoughts, then appear to be? what an ungodly face wil his moſt beloved delicious ſins than appear to have? How chearfully wil he then open his eyes to the convictions of ſin, but ſhut them againſt the Allurements thereof? Wil not the leaſt ſin there ſeem greater, than the greateſt ſin before?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Serious thoughts of the ſecond coming of Chriſt to jugement have a very efficacious influence on ſinners, in order to a deep feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe of ſin, and miſerie that attends it. Take the ſecureſt ſtouteſt ſinner in the World, and let him but have clear apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the coming of the day of God, and oh! what a load and burden wil ſin be to him? What remorſes, and ſtings wil ſmal ſins breed in his Conſcience? Wil not every act of ſin be, as a ſcalding drop of burning lead on his ſoul? What a ſpirit of bondage and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe wil he be poſſeſt withal? How ſoon wil the root of al his delights wither? Yea, an awakened Conſcience, that lies under a a deep lively ſenſe of Chriſts coming to Juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, feels no ſin ſo heavy and tormenting as his darling ſin: That ſin, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was moſt delicious to him, wil now be moſt vexatious and bitter: and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows <hi>That</hi> ſin wil coſt him moſt dear, at the coming of his Lord, if not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of. We find this exemplified in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched <hi>Felix,</hi> Act. 24.25.<note place="margin">Act. 24.25.</note> 
                     <hi>And as he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned of righteouſneſſe, temperance, and juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> Felix <hi>trembled.</hi> What made
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53798:49"/>
                     <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble? Is it not ſtrange, that a Judge ſhould tremble at a few words, of a poor priſoner, at the bar? Muſt there not be a ſtrange efficace in this diſcourſe of <hi>Paul?</hi> Yes, there was: <hi>Paul</hi> indeed hit him in the right vein: <hi>Felix</hi> was as <hi>Tacitus, Hiſt. l.</hi> 5. aſſures us, a man <hi>given up to al manner of injuſtice, and incontinence.</hi> His <hi>injuſtice</hi> in part appears from his expectation of a bribe, <hi>v.</hi> 26. His <hi>incontinence</hi> alſo is manifeſt, by taking <hi>Druſilla</hi> another mans wife as his own. Now <hi>Paul</hi> having reaſoned of <hi>righteouſneſſe and temperance</hi> virtues oppoſite to <hi>Felix</hi>'s darling luſts; and withal deſcribed to the life <hi>Jugement to come,</hi> which would take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on him for theſe ſins, oh!

Saith <hi>Felix,</hi> is there a Judge coming, that wil cal me to an account for mine <hi>Injuſtice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance?</hi> Oh! what ſhal I do then, when that day comes? What a miſerable wretch am I, to prefer theſe baſe luſts, before mine immortal ſoul? Thus the vbery apprehenſion of a Jugement to come, or a coming Judge, who would reckon with him for his Idol-luſts, caſt him, though an ignorant debauched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, into a tremblement of Conſcience. O! how many carnal ſecure ſinners, are oft, amidſt al their ſenſual pleaſures and delights, ſtartled and affrightened, at the apprehenſions of our Lords coming to judge the World? Do not ſuch thoughts as theſe, like <hi>Belſhazars

Ah! would ſecure ſinners but entertain themſelves now and then with ſuch ſerious thoughts as theſe: <hi>Wil this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual life laſt for ever? Wil not the judge ere long come, and cal me to an account, for al mine evil deeds? And wil not then my fleſh-pleaſing delights end in ſoul-tormenting do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors? Can I make my party good againſt the Almightie, or bear the wrath of the Lambe?</hi> I ſay, ſuch thoughts as theſe, would make the ſecureſt heart <hi>ake and tremble.</hi>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53798:50"/>which ruines ſo many millions of ſouls, walking ſecurely in their own luſts, they ſay, with thoſe profane ſcoffers, 2 Pet. 3.4. <hi>where is the promiſſe of his coming?</hi> Ah! had the ſenſual ſinner but a real, and ful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his approching Judge, how ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and affectionate would he be, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after, and into the means of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Was not this Doctrine of Chriſts ſecond coming to jugement, one main fundamental principle, in <hi>Peter</hi>'s firſt Sermon, that made thoſe 3000 Converts ſo inquiſitive about the means of ſalvation?<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> ſo Act. 2.37. <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>and unto the reſt of the Apoſtles, men and brethren what ſhal we do?</hi> Whats the mater? why do they crie out thus, <hi>what ſhal we do?</hi> why, <hi>they were pricked in their heart:</hi> Their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were pricked and enflamed with a ſenſe of divine wrath. But how comes this to paſſe? What is it that ſtings and gals their conſciences? 'Twas, <hi>when they heard this:</hi> i. e. <hi>Peters</hi> precedent Sermon, touching Chriſts <hi>Crucifixion, Reſurrection, Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>ſecond coming to Jugement. Peter</hi> gives them ſome Intimation, v. 20. <hi>Of the great and notable day of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 21. That <hi>thoſe who called on the name of the Lord ſhould be ſaved.</hi> Then, to make this poſition good, he goes on to prove the Reſurrection and Exaltation of Chriſt as King and Judge of the World. Whence <hi>v.</hi> 36. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes: <hi>Therefore let al the houſe of Iſrael
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53798:50"/>know aſſuredly, that God hath made the ſame Jeſus, whom ye have crucified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> As if he had ſaid: <q>Aſſure your ſelves, ye are thoſe foes, <hi>v.</hi> 35. whom, if you continue ſuch, the <hi>Lord wil make his footſtool.</hi> There is a black day coming when this Son of God, whom ye have Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, ſhal cal you to an account for al your bloudy deſignes, and Actions, againſt his Royal perſon, crown, and dignitie: For, believe it, God hath made him both <hi>Lord</hi> and judge, of quick and dead.</q> Hence it follows, v. 37. <hi>Now when they heard this,</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> that he, whom they had crucified, was made, by God the Father, both Lord and Judge of al] <hi>they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid— what ſhal we do?</hi> As if they had ſaid: <q>Is it ſo indeed? Is he whom we crucified, now exalted by God, to be both Lord and Chriſt? And wil he ere long come to judge us, for al our deſloyaltie and treaſon againſt him? Shal al his foes then become his footſtool? Oh! then, for the Lords ſake, tel us, ſirs, what we ſhal do, to be ſaved in that great day? We wil ſtick at no means, under Heaven, for the ſaving of our ſouls.</q> Thus, being deeply convinced of Chriſts Exaltation, and ſecond coming to judge the World, the firſt inquiry they make is, <hi>what ſhal we do to be ſaved?</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al peradventure, the expectation of Chriſts coming to judge the world was a main foundation, and principle of the <hi>Jaylors</hi> inquirie, Act. 16.30. <hi>SIrs, what muſt I do
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53798:51"/>to be ſaved?</hi> The coming or the day of God wil be moſt terrible to ſecure ſinners, and therefore no wonder, if the ſerious expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations thereof make awakened conſciences inquiſitive about ſalvation. When the <hi>Lion</hi> roars the beaſts of the foreſt tremble, and ſeek refuge: So when Chriſt, the <hi>Lion of Judah,</hi> roars in mens Conſciences, by lively convictions of his approching jugement, how ſoon doth the ſtouteſt ſinner tremble, and ſeek out for refuge. Thus when Chriſt pleads his Controverſie with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and threatens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Jugement, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.1—5. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they fal upon their <hi>Inquiries,</hi> though but <hi>legal,</hi> v. 6. <hi>wherewith ſhal I come before the Lord, and how my ſelf before the high God,</hi> &amp;c? What more natural to an awakened conſcience, apprehenſive of preſent or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching Jugements, than ſerious Inquiſition how to eſcape ſuch Jugements?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Serious and fiducial looking for the coming of Chriſt have a mighty forcible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on ſinners, in order to a deep <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> for, and <hi>turning</hi> from ſin. If we conſult the Scripture, we ſhal find, that the great <hi>Argument,</hi> and <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> which the Apoſtles uſed to turne men from ſin, was the powerful preaching of the ſecond coming of Chriſt to Jugement. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> what ſubject doth he chooſe to Preach on among thoſe great wits? Why 'twas the plain doctrine of Repentance, or <hi>Humiliation</hi> for, and <hi>Averſion</hi> from ſin, Act. 17.30.<note place="margin">Act. 17.30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>And the times of this ignorance
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53798:51"/>God ninked at; but now commandeth al men every where to repent.</hi> Ay, but what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reaſon doth he bring to prove this Doctrine, unto theſe curious wits? That fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: v. 31. <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day, in the which he wil judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by that man, whom he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> &amp;c. So that here lay the force and ſtrength of his exhortation, even in the coming of our Lord to Judge the World. Its true, many of theſe proud <hi>Athenian wits</hi> were not at al moved by this Argument, but rather ſcoffed, and mocqued at it, <hi>v.</hi> 32. But what courſe doth <hi>Paul</hi> take then? Why, v. 33. <hi>So</hi> Paul <hi>departed from among them:</hi> As ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never a word more to ſay unto them. Implying, that if the Doctrine of Chriſts ſecond coming to Jugement would not prevail with them, to humble, and turne them from ſin, nothing would, in an ordinary way. What more eſtectual for the killing of ſin than fiducial ſights of our coming Lord? when the eye of the mind is fixed on the approche of the great Judge, how is the Bent of the wil turned againſt ſin? How eaſily can they part with beloved luſts, whoſe eyes are intent on the coming of the day of God? What ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual combats and conflicts againſt ſin wil they maintain, who live in the dayly expectation of their approching Lord?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Serious expectations of the coming of our Lord have, when ſanctified by the Spirit of Grace, no ſmal Influence, not only for the averſion of the heart from ſin, but alſo for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53798:52"/>the Converſion of it to God. Heart-affecting views of our approching Lord, are, when animated by the ſpirit of God, a ſoverain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for the turning of the heart to God. Thus <hi>Peter,</hi> in his ſecond Sermon to the Jews, Act. 3.19.<note place="margin">Act. 3.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Repent ye therefore and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhal come, from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> The force of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> exhortation, whereby he preſſeth them to turne from ſin unto God, lies in this, <hi>That their ſins might be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhal come, from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>

Knowing therefore the terrors of the Lord, in that day, we perſuade men, by faith to embrace him in this day of Grace. Thus alſo he informes us, that the Converſion of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> was in this manner, 1 Theſ. 1.9, 10. <hi>How ye turned to God from Idols, and to wait for his Son from Heaven.</hi> So that it ſeems, this was the Apoſtles ordinary method, in converting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to fixe on their ſouls a deep conviction, and <hi>impreſſion</hi> of Chriſts ſecond coming to jugement. And verily Sirs, were this great fundamental principle more powerfully preached, and deeply impreſſed on mens Conſciences, we might expect many more Converts, than now we find: Of ſuch ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain influence is it to turne men to God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Serious lively thoughts of Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming has oft a powerful Influence, for the reſtraining the luſts and reforming the lives, even of ſuch as are not throughly converted, or turned to God. Alas! how many awakened ſinners, are hereby brought to a great degree of <hi>partial Reformation?</hi> What made politic <hi>Herod</hi> hear <hi>John Bapriſt</hi> gladly, and do many things he preſcribed, but fears of this great day? Was not this alſo that, which made <hi>Agrippa</hi> an <hi>Almoſt-Chriſtian,</hi> Act. 26.28? Its a wonder to think, what a change this has made on many Awakened Conſciences. What a forme of Godlineſſe have many hypocrites attained unto? What a ſeeming exact conformitie to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53798:53"/>the letter of the Law, have they given? How many, not only outward acts of ſin, but alſo inward Luſts have been for a time, not only ſuſpended, but in part quenched. What pretentions of obedience to, and dependence on Chriſt? What ſeeming Adherence to, and Application of Chriſt, by faith? What legal deſires of Grace? In ſhort, what a ſeeming Reformation of heart and life have many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites arrived unto, by a ſerious, though but legal looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God? Yea, do not the thoughts of this great day, leave an awe on the conſciences not only of <hi>mor l,</hi> but alſo of many debauched perſons? And are they not hereby reſtrained from many ſins and outragious violences, which otherwiſe they would commit? Alas! were it not that this principle of Chriſts coming to Jugement were, more or leſſe, impreſſed on mens Conſciences, how ſoon would the wicked world be al in flames and bloudy tumults? How impoſſible would it be for a Saint to live without great hazards in any human ſocietie, where wicked men prevail? At what an inconceivable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of rage and malice would the ſpirits of unreaſonable men ſwel, and vent themſelves againſt the people of God, had they not ſome commun notions, and Impreſſions of this great day of Jugement? So that its evident much of the power and force of reſtraining Grace, on the wicked world, procedes from this principle deeply fixed on mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. And therefore the laſt refuge the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53798:53"/>Church has to curbe and reſtrain licentious profeſſors is a <hi>Maranatha,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22.</note> 1 Cor. 16.22. which is a Syriac word, and ſignifie, <hi>our Lord cometh.</hi> This, they ſay, was the forme of the extreme and higheſt excommunication, as we find it expreſſed Jude 14. <hi>the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2. HAving explicated, what powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the ſerious expectation of the day of God has on ſinners, we now procede to ſhew how efficacious its Influence on Saints is. And this indeed ſeems mainly intended in our text: For, albeit the ſerious thoughts of this great day may, when ſet home by the Spirit of Grace, be of great uſe to convince, and convert ſome, as alſo to reſtrain others, from many exorbitent courſes; yet its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that ſecure ſinners do what they can to baniſh al ſuch ſerious thoughts from their hearts. Oh! what a torment, yea hel is it to wicked men to lie under ſerious thoughts of this great day? It is the Saint only that hath either <hi>capacitie,</hi> or <hi>wil</hi> to draw forth the efficace, of ſuch a ſerious looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of the day of God. And thence our Apoſtle here directs his exhortation mainly to Saints: <hi>What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons ought YE to be, in al holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſſe?</hi> Oh! what miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures were the Saints, ſhould not Chriſt come again to judge the world? How much then doth it concerne them to eye this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53798:54"/>great day? And what a forcible influence hath ſuch thoughts on their hearts and lives? O! how many, and rich promiſſes hath our Lord made to this looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God? And, what emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent raiſures of ſpirit have ſuch arrived unto, who live under the power and Influence of this frame? Is there any principle in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, that has a more ſoveraign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Divine life, than this? What made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo heavenly-minded, but daily looking for the coming of his Lord? Whence was it that <hi>Peter</hi> had his heart ſo much filled with love to Chriſt, and his Lambs, but from his continual expectation of his Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne?

What more effectual to draw off the heart from this lower world, than our dayly drawing nigh, in thoughts and affections, to the coming of the day of God?

So that if you would be able to <hi>withſtand</hi> in the evil day of tentation, and after al aſſaults to <hi>ſtand,</hi> as <hi>conquerors,</hi> you muſt ever keep in your eye the coming of the day of God. This ſhield of faith wil quench al the <hi>ficry,</hi> or <hi>poiſoned darts</hi> of Satan. O! how tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant is the croſſe of Chriſt, in the hearts of believers, over Satan and al his fleſh-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing tentations, ſo long as they have their eyes fixed on the approches of their Lord?

                     </gap>, a <hi>quadrate</hi> or <hi>fourſquare man:</hi> caſt him which way you wil, he ſtil finds a bottome. And it is moſt certain, that ſo far as we are Godly, ſo far we are ſtable. God is the moſt <hi>ſtable</hi> and <hi>immoveable</hi> Being: and by how much the more any creature draws near to God, either by <hi>reſſemblance,</hi> or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>communion,</hi> by ſo much the ſtable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable it wil be. True Godlineſſe implies a conſiſtence of ſoul: Grace is ballaſt or weight to the ſoul; it poiſeth and fixeth the heart: a fickle wavering inſtable ſpirit never excels in Godlineſſe. This was <hi>Reubens</hi> caſe, Gen. 49.4. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable as water, thou ſhalt not excel.</hi> Inconſtant inſtable ſpirits, that

So Eſa. 57.20. <hi>But the wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> Reſtleſſe fluctuating ſpirits always caſt up mire and dirt. Firmitude and ſtabilitie in a Chriſtian courſe, is the beautie and glorie of Godlineſſe: whereas Ambulatorie moveable diſpoſitions are uſually a reproche thereto. None ſo fit to receive Grace from God, to act for God, and to walk with God, as hearts eſtabliſht in Grace: and thence, none ſo Godly as theſe. Now dayly waiting for the coming of the day of God, has a powerful influence on this heart-eſtabliſhment in Grace. There is a threefold eſtabliſhment of heart, which is much influenced by ſerious thoughts of our Lords ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Eſtabliſhment of Jugement; when the mind is united and fixed as to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and truths of the Goſpel. What more inconſtant and inſtable than the vain mind of of man? What <hi>riſings</hi> and <hi>fallings</hi> of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are many inſtable minds ſubject unto? Some minds are ſo inconſtant, as that nothing wil pleaſe them long: they are ſtable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in nothing but <hi>Inſtabilitie</hi> and <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> They are indeed a mere <hi>Bethaven,</hi> an houſe of <hi>vanitie,</hi> Hoſ. 4.15. Of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeakes Heb. 13.9. <hi>Be not carried about with diverſe and ſtrange doctrines: For it is a good thing the heart be eſtabliſht with Grace, and not with meats.</hi> By <hi>Grace</hi> here we may underſtand the doctrine of the Goſpel,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53798:65"/>as oppoſed to the legal ceremonies; which many Judaiſing Chriſtians too much doted on. Ay, but now how might they get their minds eſtabliſhed in the Grace of the Goſpel? that he lays down, v. 13, 14. <hi>Let us go forth to him without the campe, bearing his reproche. For we have no continuing Citie, but ſeek one to come.</hi> Oh! ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> would men but go forth and meet their approching Lord, what an influence would it have to fixe their minds, in the Grace of the Goſpel? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Col. 1.23. <hi>If ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinune in the faith grounded, and ſetled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> This later has a <hi>cauſal</hi> influence on the former: The hope of the Goſpel, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the coming of our Lord, is a ſoverain means to keep the heart grounded and ſetled in the faith.

                  <p n="2">(2.) Serious expectations of Chriſts coming have a ſoverain Influence on the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of our heart and ways, in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian race. The more ſtable and fixed our hearts are, in our Chriſtian obedience, the more Godly we are: As a ſquare figure is immoveable in every poſture; ſo ought a Godly man to be, in the whole of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian race. Our hearts and workes are ſo far Godly, as they anſwer to Gods ſtabilitie and equalitie. For Grace infuſeth a <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Vigor</hi> into the ſoul; whereby our ways are rendred ſtable and uniforme. And, oh! what an efficacious Influence hath the lively view of our Lords coming hereon? There are two main ſprings of heart-eſtabliſhment in our Chriſtian race, and both are greatly influenced by ſerious thoughts of the coming of our Lord. The firſt great ſpring of heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment is, the conſtant keeping a ſingle end in our eye. For he that has a double
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53798:66"/>end in his eye, wil alſo have a double inſtable motion:<note place="margin">Jam. 1.8.</note> So Jam. 1.8. <hi>A double minded man is inſtable in al his wayes.</hi> Now ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of our Lords coming keep a ſingle end alwayes in our eye. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.26. <hi>I therefore ſo run,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.26.</note>

                     <hi>They ſay, looking to a certain end, not in vain,</hi> &amp;c. The metaphor is taken from men that run in a race, who have the <hi>Goal,</hi> and Crown ever in their eye; which keeps them ſtable and active in their race. <hi>Paul</hi> had his Lords coming, and the Crown of Glorie then to be reveled, ever in his eye, and that made him ſtable in his race. Again, another cauſe of ſtabilitie in our race is a <hi>ſtrait way:</hi> This follows on the former: for a ſtrait ſingle end brings a ſtrait ſingle way: and as both greatly conduce to <hi>ſtabilitie;</hi> So are they promoted by ſerious expectations of our Lords coming. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> in his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.12—14.</note> 1 Tim. 6.12. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>contend in the Agonie of faith.</hi> Its a metaphor from ſuch as contended in running the race, and it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a continued uninterrupted motion in our Chriſtian race. Thence he addes: <hi>lay hold on eternal life.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>apprehend, catch at.</hi> This alludes to the poſture of <hi>racers,</hi> who, when they came near the Goal, gave a ſpring forward, and catcht at the Crown, which lay on the top of the Goal, which is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53798:67"/>expreſſed Phil. 3.13. <hi>by reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> unto a ſtrait ſtable courſe and motion in his Chriſtian race. Ay, but what argument doth he urge to enforce this exhortation? Surely, his main argument is drawen from the coming of our Lord. So v. 13. <hi>I give thee charge in the ſight of God, who quickeneth althings,</hi> i. e. at the ſecond coming of our Lord, by the reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again v. 14. <hi>That thou keep this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without ſpot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is here brought in, not only as a <hi>period</hi> or <hi>terme,</hi> but alſo as a <hi>motive</hi> of <hi>Timothies</hi> keeping this great commandement. Oh! what a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence would this have to keep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors ſtrait and ſtable in their Chriſtian race, would they but alwayes eye the coming of our Lord, and that Crown of Glorie laid up for ſuch as overcome. This <hi>Paul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, was that which influenced his heart, in his Chriſtian race, 2 Tim. 4.7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe I have kept the faith,</hi> i. e. I have walked in an equal, ſtable, fixed courſe of faith and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And what was it that engaged him hereto, but the expectation of Chriſts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>v.</hi> 8?</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Lively expectations of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very influential on heart-eſtabliſhment as to ſuffering: it eſtabliſheth the heart not only in <hi>active</hi> obedience to Gods <hi>Wil of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53798:67"/>precept;</hi> but alſo in <hi>paſſive,</hi> as to his <hi>wil of providence.</hi> And herein, indeed, much of Godlineſſe doth conſiſt: For who more God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than he, whoſe heart is eſtabliſht in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, as wel as doing the wil of God? and what hath more powerful influence hereon, than fiducial expectations of Chriſts ſecond coming? Thus Jam. 5.8. <hi>Be ye alſo patient, ſtabliſh your hearts, for the coming of your Lord draweth nigh.</hi> The length of ſufferings uſually breeds impatience under them: But then a conſideration, that the coming of our Lord draweth nigh, is a moſt prevalent means to eſtabliſh the heart under them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Raiſed expectations of our Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have a very ſoverain influence on a Chriſtian's growth in Grace. He is a Godly man in truth, who ſets no bounds, or meſures to his Grace, but aims at a kind of <hi>Infinitie</hi> therein. Its a black marque, that mens Grace is not ſincere, if they ſtint or limit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to the meſure thereof. Chriſtians ſhould, ſpecially in theſe evangelic days, aim at the higheſt <hi>raiſures</hi> and procedures in Grace. Much Grace brings much ſtrength, much peace, much communion with, and much ſervice for God: The more <hi>extenſive,</hi> and <hi>intenſive</hi> your Grace is, the more Godly you are. Whats the reaſon why ſo many profeſſors can do, or ſuffer ſo little for God, have ſo little beautie and glorie on their lives, but becauſe they have ſo little of Grace in their hearts? Now what more prevalent and efficacious to make Chriſtians thrive in Grace,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53798:68"/>than ſpiritual and affectionate expectations of our coming Lord? Thus in our text,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.11, 12.</note> v. 11. <hi>What manner of perſons ought ye to be?</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Oh! What an eminence in Grace ought ye to aim at? what tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent frames ſhould ye endeavor after? how heavenly-minded and affectionate towards God; how ſpiritual, and ſerious ought ye to be in al your converſation? why ſo? why; becauſe al theſe things here below muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Ay, but might they object, how may we get to ſuch excellent raiſures in Grace? That he addes, in what follows, v. 12. <hi>looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of the day of God.</hi> This ſeems to be brought in, as that which would have a very great cauſal influence on growth in Godlineſſe. Alas! how comes it to paſſe, that profeſſors in this day are ſo low, and poor in Grace? Whence is it that we come ſo far ſhort of former Chriſtians, as to growth in Grace and Godlineſſe? Is not this the true reaſon, becauſe we come ſhort in our expectations of our Lords ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Its true, we ſeem much higher than the profeſſors of former ages, as to puritie of Worſhip, Doctrine, and Diſcipline: ay, but are we not much lower than they, as to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of heart and life? And why; but becauſe we have not thoſe lively expectations of that great day, which their hearts were poſſeſſed withal? How comes it to paſſe, that our ſpiritual <hi>Fervors</hi> and <hi>heats</hi> are not more proportionable to our <hi>Lights;</hi> but becauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r lights are not more proportionable to the coming of the day
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53798:68"/>of God? Oh! what an high value would men put on Grace, with a low value on althings elſe, did they but daily expect the coming of their Lord? Surely nothing doth more raiſe the price of Grace, than raiſed expectations of that glorious day: and there is good reaſon why; becauſe nothing wil ſtand us in ſtead at that great day, but Grace. What would the fooliſh Virgins give for the oil of Grace, when they hear the rumor of the Bridegrooms approche; <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.8? And what would the man invited to the mariage feaſt give for a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment of Grace, when he ſtands at the dore and receives a repulſe? How would the mercat of Grace riſe; and with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie would Saints ſeek after the higheſt raiſures thereof, did they but ſeriouſly wait for the coming of their Lord? For a Saint has this principle fixed in his heart, that he can never look Chriſt in the face with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, without Grace in his heart: and the more Grace, the more boldneſſe in that day.</p>

Hence, he is a Godly man indeed, who hath got the Art and Skil of ordering his heart and converſation aright. With ſuch a ſoul God dwels, and to him he ſheweth his ſalvation. So Pſal. 50.23. <hi>And to him that ordereth his converſation aright, wil I ſhew the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi> Now nothing has a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain efficace for the ordering our hearts and lives aright, than deep conſtant expectations of our Lords approche. O! what an exact order are ſuch mens ſouls and converſations in, who daily expect the coming of their Lord? how harmonious are their thoughts? how uniforme and equal are their Affections? What a ſweet concent and exact meſure is there in al their ways? This ſeems implied in that great Admonition of our Lord, Luke 12.35, 36. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning: and ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord, when he wil returne from the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately.</hi> The <hi>girding of the loins, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53798:69"/>burning of their lights,</hi> with their <hi>waiting for the returne of their Lord,</hi> do al implie a good order of heart and life: and whence ſpringeth al this, but from ſerious thoughts and expectations of our Lords coming? The Alluſion ſeems to be unto the cuſtome of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who, when they were under expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Lords returne, were mighty care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſet althings in order, and preparation for him. Lively thoughts of Chriſts coming preſerve the ſoul in its due order, by making Eternitie near. If we have tidings, that a perſon of great qualitie is coming to viſit us, how are althings immediately ſet at rights? what care is there to put every thing in its place? So here, when the ſoul lies under deep impreſſions of the near approche of the Lord of Glorie, how ſtudious and exact is it in ſetting al its thoughts, Affections, motions, and ways in order? what a ſweet Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and agrement wil there be in its thoughts? how regular, and <hi>conſonant</hi> wil its affections be? what a beautiful <hi>Decorum</hi> wil there be in its Actions and motions? This is evident in perſons on their death-bed, who having lively views of Eternitie, and their near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche thereto, are moſt careful to ſet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things in order. Thence 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.1. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſick unto death, <hi>Eſaias,</hi> by Gods appointment, bids him <hi>ſet his houſe in order, for he ſhould die.</hi> Indeed, it is natural and moſt commun for Chriſtians, at the approche of death, to ſet althings, both of ſoul and eſtate in order: and why? becauſe

So that had we, as we ought to have, ſuch lively views of our Lords coming at al times, what an admirable order, harmonie, and concent would there be in our hearts, and converſations?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Heart-affecting views of our Lords coming have a prevalent Influence on Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vigilance or Watchfulneſſe, which is another great piece of Godlineſſe. The Life and power of Godlineſſe is much maintained by a ſpiritual watching over our hearts and ways. Uſually the more or leſſe vigilant we are, the more or leſſe Godly we are. None thrive more in Godlineſſe, than ſuch as are the moſt curious obſervers of their own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Inclinations, affections, and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on al occaſions, as to tentations, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But, Oh! how dangerous is a ſleepy profeſſion? What a world of evils attend a ſlumbering profeſſor? how ſoon do ſhort ſleeps harden? And what more commun in theſe laſt days, than ſpiritual ſlumbers even among Virgin proſeſſors? Yea; how apt are Chriſtians to be over-taken with ſlumbering fits, even under the greateſt dangers, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? And whence comes this to paſſe, but from putting far off the coming of their Lord: Thus it is with the ten Virgins, as wel wiſe as fooliſh,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.5.</note> Mat. 25.5. <hi>while the bridegroom tarried, they al ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi> This refers to theſe laſt days of the world, in which our Lord premoniſheth us, that the great ſin of profeſſors would be ſpiritual
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53798:71"/>ſlumber, and ſecuritie, ariſing from the <hi>bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms tarrying,</hi> i. e. their not apprehending the nearneſſe of his approche. Whence it follows, by natural conſequence, that the more clearly and fully we apprehend the Bridegrooms approche, and the nearneſſe thereof, the more vigilant and watchful we ſhal be. There are two main parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vigilance: (1.) To watch againſt ſin and Tentation. (2.) To watch unto dutie. Now both of theſe are greatly promoted by lively expectations of our Lords approche. (1.) Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contemplation of our Lords coming, is a prevalent means to keep the ſoul vigilant and watchful againſt ſin and tentations thereto. Thus Mat. 24.42, 43. <hi>Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour, your Lord doth come, But know this, that if the good man of the houſe had known, in what watch the thief would come, be would have watched, and would not have ſuffered his houſe to be broken up.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> applies to our Chriſtian vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance againſt Tentation,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.2—6.</note> 1 Theſ. 5.2—6. v. 2. <hi>For your ſelves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord ſo cometh as a thief in the night.</hi> He refers to the foregoing Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of our Lord, which was communly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in al the Churches. And what doth he infer hence? v. 6. <hi>Therefore let us not ſleep, as do others; but let us watch and be ſober.</hi> He brings in the unexpected coming of our Lord, as a forcible motive, to provoke al Chriſtians unto Chriſtian vigilance againſt Tentation. What is the reaſon that many
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53798:72"/>profeſſors are ſo ſoon overcome by ſmal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and hardened in ſin, but becauſe they watch not againſt them? And why is it that that they watch not againſt ſin and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauſe they expect not the coming of Chriſt? (2.) Frequent and affectionate expectations of our Lords coming are exced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powerful, to keep the ſoul vigilant and watchful as to dutie. Continual vigilance over the worke God cals us to, is a great marque of Godlineſſe. He is a Godly man indeed, who watcheth al occaſions of doing good, and of being faithful in every relation, and ſervice God cals him unto. And what greater incentive or argument have we to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us hereto, than dayly expectations of our Lords approche.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.44—46.</note> Having exhorted them, and us to watch <hi>v.</hi> 42, 43. he addes v. 44. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ye alſo ready: for in ſuch an hour as you thinke not, the Son of man cometh.</hi>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53798:72"/>were. Thence he concludes, v. 46. <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhal find ſo doing.</hi> As if he had ſaid: <hi>He is a faithful and bleſſed ſervant indeed, who thus watcheth al opportunities of ſervice:</hi> Now al this is but the effect of ſerious expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of Chriſts ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Daily and fiducial expectations of Chriſts ſecond coming are greatly prevalent, to wind up the Soul to a <hi>Life of faith;</hi> which is a main ſpring, and eſſential part of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For what is Godlineſſe, but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving or melting the wil of man into the wil of God? And how is this brought about, but by faith, which bends the human wil to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with, and conformitie to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wil? He is the Godly man indeed, to whom God is althings, and the creature no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: who admires nothing but God: who makes God the <hi>firſt principe</hi> of his Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the <hi>laſt end</hi> in point of fruition. And are not theſe the proper iſſues of faith? And what more effectual to worke the heart to ſuch an active faith, than fixed and raiſed expectations of the coming of our Lord? The Life of faith hath ſeven main <hi>venes</hi> or <hi>branches,</hi> which are al animated or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by believing views of our Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) A main part of the life of faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the realiſing of thoſe good things hoped for. So Heb. 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> [or <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi>] <hi>of things hoped for and evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> i. e. Faith
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53798:73"/>makes things future preſent; things inviſible viſible. And how is it that faith workes ſuch wonders, but by real views of the coming of our Lord? Faith, by fixing its eye on that glorious day, gives the ſoul a ſpiritual real view of al thoſe coming glories, which attend and follow that day.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Another branch of the life of faith conſiſts in thoſe prelibations, and foretaſtes of approching Glories, which believers, at times, are made partakers of. And what more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious to animate this part of the life of faith, than lively views of our Lords near approche? Thus Epheſ. 1.13. <hi>In whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Much of the life of faith conſiſts in ſpiritual groans after the diſſolution of this ſinful frail Tabernacle, in order to a more complete union with our Lord. This fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows on the former; For they who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome prelibations of approching glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, cannot but long after a diſſolution of this ſinful ſtate, in order to a more intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their Lord. And whence ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this, but from ſerious expectations of our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53798:73"/>Lords approche? So Rom. 8.23.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> 
                     <hi>And not only they, but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the-Spirit, even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemtion of our bodie.</hi> Look as the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taſted off the cluſters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the ful poſſeſſion of that goodly land: O! ſay they, when ſhal we ſet foot in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan?</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> having taſted of the firſt-fruits of Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> groans, and longs after a diſſolution, in order to his more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate conjunction with his Lord. And that which made him groan more earneſtly, was his waiting for the <hi>Adoption,</hi> namely at the coming of our Lord. The like 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>For we know, that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, an houſe not made with hands eternal in the Heavens. Paul</hi> takes this for grant, that if his bodie were once diſſolved his ſoul ſhould be houſed with God: he ſhould meet his Lord. What follows hence? v. 2. <hi>For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with our houſe, which is from Heaven.</hi>

                     <hi>In,</hi> or <hi>for this we groan.</hi> That which made him groan after a diſſolution of his bodie, was the union of his ſoul with his abſent Lord, as <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Another part of the liſe of faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an holy reſignation to the wil of God in althings. Herein alſo much of the life and power of Godlineſſe doth conſiſt. And what more powerful to breed ſuch a reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53798:74"/>to the wil of God, than lively expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our coming Lord? O! how gladly would ſuch have Chriſt to diſpoſe of al their affairs? What content can they take in every condition God cals them unto? If they meet with a darke providence, how much do they perſuade their hearts quietly to ſubmit to the Divine wil therein? Whence procede al our clamors, and murmurs againſt the Divine wil, but from ſome defect or neglect in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſts coming? O! how patient and meek wil ſuch be, who continually expect their Lords approche? So Jam. 5.7. <hi>Be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and the later rain.</hi> The coming of the Lord is here brought in as the ground of Chriſtian patience, or ſubmiſſion to the wil of God. v. 8. <hi>Be ye alſo patient, ſtabliſh your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Again, the life of faith conſiſts much in the Art and Myſterie of bearing the Croſſe; which is much improved by ſerious thoughts of our Lords near Approche. Lively expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of Chriſts ſecond coming take out the ſting and poiſon of every Croſſe, and infuſe a medicinal vertue into it. O! how is the black croſſe made beautiful; the heavy croſſe made eaſy and leight; the ſour bitter croſſe made ſweet by ſpiritual ſights of our Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche?

They count their diſhonors and Diſgraces for the name of Chriſt great marques of honor and grace: and why? becauſe they meſured al by the coming of the day of God. What more ſoverain cordial can there be, to revive the drooping deſpondent ſpirits of troubled Saints, than ſaving heart-affecting views of their Lords approche? And there is good reaſon for it; becauſe then the troubled Saint ſhal be freed from al his preſſing fears, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, tentations, and ſins. This was the ground of the Apoſtles conſolation to the afflicted <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> who lived under the croſſe al their days: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. he gives them a lively Image, or deſcription of the coming of our Lord: and then concludes, v. 18. <hi>wherefore comfort one another with theſe words.</hi> O! what a ſpring of conſolation is here? If thou art much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch thoughts, I dare ſay thou canſt be no ſtranger to true comfort. Oh! how much comfort might Saints enjoy, amidſt al their croſſes, would they but feed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh their hearts with frequent expectations of their Lords ſecond coming? Do not the pureſt and beſt conſolations come in this way? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> comforts the ſame <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7. <hi>And to you who are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53798:75"/>troubled reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhal be reveled from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi> He ſtil makes this the ground of his conſolation to thoſe afflicted Saints, namely the <hi>Revelation</hi> of our Lord from Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Another <hi>vital</hi> branch of the life of faith conſiſts in dependence on Chriſt, for actual Grace, in al conditions and duties, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>active</hi> or <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience; wherein alſo much of the life and power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth conſiſt. A Godly man is the moſt paſſive dependent creature in the World; He can neither do nor ſuffer any thing as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, without abſolute, immediate, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal dependence on Chriſt by faith. And what more effectually promotes ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dependence on Chriſt, than ſerious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of our Lords approche? How pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully is the ſoul drawen to depend on Chriſt for al Grace, by a ſpiritual view of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearence? who more dependent on Chriſt, than ſuch, who live daily in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his returne? A believing ſoul, that has a ſpiritual conſtant regard to the coming of his Lord, ſees al fulneſſe of Grace in him, and al emtineſſe in himſelf. What makes men more negligent in taking hold of Grace when offered, than putting far from them the coming of their Lord? How comes it to paſſe, that proud man affecteth to be ſelf-ſufficient, as God, but becauſe he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not the exact jugement, which wil follow on the coming of our Lord? He that eyeth that great day, ſeeth a neceſſitie of putting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53798:75"/>al his ſtock and treaſure in Chriſts hands. The ſame faith, that draweth forth the ſoul to regard the coming of his Lord, draweth divine Influences from him, in order to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for that day, as Joh. 15.5. <hi>He that abideth in me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) The laſt part of the life of faith is patiently to wait for the reward of al our ſervices, and ſufferings. And is not this alſo greatly promoted by ſpiritual expectations of our Lords approche? (1.) This as to ſervice is evident from Heb. 10.35. <hi>Caſt not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</hi> 36. <hi>For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the wil of God, ye might receive the promiſſe,</hi> i. e. <hi>the thing promiſſed.</hi> Now what argument doth the Author uſe to excite them unto a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducial waiting for the recompence of reward? That follows v. 37. <hi>For yet a little while, and he that ſhal come, wil come, and wil not tarry.</hi> Here lies the force of his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in the ſpeedy returne of our Lord. (2.) So alſo as to <hi>ſufferings,</hi> what made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo patiently to wait for the <hi>recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> but his ſeeing him who is inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26, 27? i. e.

Raiſed expectations of our Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have alſo a prevalent Influence on Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; which is a great ſpring of Godlineſſe. The more Aſſurance Saints have, the more Godly uſually they are: For the ſenſe of Gods love to them is moſteſſicacious, to draw
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53798:76"/>forth their love and obedience unto God: To be ſure that Chriſt is ours, makes us to do and ſuffer the moſt for Chriſt. Apprehended love is more powerful, than apprehended wrath to keep the ſoul in ways of dutie: The more the heart is aſſured of an Intereſt in Chriſt, the more the Intereſt of Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in the heart and life: Aſſurance of being in a ſtate of Grace enlargeth the heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much Grace from Chriſt. Such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Influence has Aſſurance on Godlineſſe. And O! what a ſoverain Influence has raiſed expectations of our Lords approche on Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Such thoughts have a twofold Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) By way of <hi>motive,</hi> as they preſſe, and provoke the heart to labor after aſſurance. I no way dout, ſirs, but were our hearts poſſeſt with daily and freſh apprehenſions of Chriſts ſecond coming to jugement, we could not content our ſelves in ſuch doutful peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures about our ſtate, as now we take up with. A ſoul that lies under deep expectations of Chriſts ſecond coming, wil thus reaſon in himſelf: What! wil my Lord ere long come to jugement? and muſt I then appear before him in my native colors? Oh! what may I do then, to be aſſured of an intereſt in his favor? what more effectual to put men upon heart-examination, than ſuch a conſtant mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lords approche to Jugement? Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. tels us, <hi>that every mans worke, ſhal be tried by fire, in that day,</hi> which is a ſtrong argument to put us on the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53798:76"/>examination of our heart and workes, in order to aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Actual fixed thoughts of Chriſts coming have a great Influence on Aſſurance by way of <hi>real evidence:</hi> They are not only a <hi>motive,</hi> but <hi>ſubſtantial ground</hi> to bottome aſſurance on: what better note or ſigne of the ſinceritie of thy Grace can there be, than a fiducial chearful looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God? Be ſure, an hypocrite fears nothing more: nothing ſtrikes a greater dampe on his ſpirit, than the apprehenſions of Chriſts ſecond coming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then al his rottenneſſe, and hypocriſie ſhal be diſcovered. I dare pronounce that perſon a Saint, who can in good earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and with a wel-grounded confidence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſecond coming of Chriſt to jugement. Yea, this is a ſigne not only of ſinceritie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of an eminence in Grace, and therefore a ſubſtantial evidence, and bottome for Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Serious thoughts of the coming of Chriſt have a forcible influence on the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on and improvement of friendſhip with God in Chriſt. The ancient Gloſſarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets <gap reason="foreign">

For look as friendſhip bends it ſelf to <hi>ſerve, pleaſe,</hi> and <hi>conforme</hi> unto its friend; ſo Godlineſſe to ſerve, pleaſe, and conforme unto God. Now what more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to maintain and improve friendſhip with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53798:77"/>God in Chriſt, than lively expectations of our Lords approche? (1.) One part of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſiſteth in <hi>Reſſemblance</hi> of, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie</hi> unto our friend: when mens prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, diſpoſitions, ends, humors, converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and manner of life is one and the ſame. And what is there more efficacious to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch an holy friendſhip with God, than ſerious expectations of the coming of our Lord? Oh! how ambitious wil ſuch be to have one and the ſame <hi>Mind, Wil, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi> with Chriſt? <hi>Paul</hi> was one of the beſt friends Chriſt ever had on earth: and wherein lay his friendſhip chiefly, but in conformitie to the death and life of Chriſt?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.10, 11.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>Always bearing about in the bodie, the dying of the Lord Jeſus, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be manifeſt in our bodie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> was cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable as wel to the <hi>death,</hi> as to the <hi>life</hi> of Chriſt: As Chriſt died for ſin, ſo he died to ſin: And as Chriſt lived to God, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in his meſure. Chriſt was his great exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar, both in regard of <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience: Chriſts exemple was not only the <hi>Rule,</hi> but alſo <hi>Reaſon</hi> of his obedience: The love of Chriſt to him, and his love to Chriſt prevailed on him to live the life of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: The end of his ſuffering for and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt was to manifeſt the life of Chriſt. And what did wind up his Spirit to ſuch a divine friendſhip, and conformitie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, but ſerious thoughts of his ſecond coming? So <hi>John</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, 3. that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53798:77"/>every one, who hath hopes of being found at laſt day a friend of Chriſt, purifieth himſelf as he is pure. And <hi>Paul</hi> informes us, Tit. 2.11, 12. <hi>That the Grace of God teacheth us, that denying ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World,</hi> i. e. in ſhort, that we ſhould demonſtrate our friendſhip to Chriſt by manifeſting the life of Chriſt.

                  <p n="3">(3.) Another part of Godly friendſhip with Chriſt conſiſts in importunate deſires, and endeavors to ſerve him. Its a great ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſerious <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> S. <hi>Cyran: One of the moſt principal rules for ſolid devotion is, that we let not paſſe the leaſt occaſion for ſerving God.</hi> If there be any <hi>vacuum,</hi> or emty ſpace in our lives, the Devil wil be ſure to fil it up, and ſo obſtruct our friendſhip with Chriſt. What more obſequious and officious than friendſhip? and who are more induſtrious, and unwearied in the ſervice of Chriſt, than ſuch friends of his, who dayly expect his ſecond coming?

A ſoul that lives much in the expectation of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wil ſpend as much time and ſtrength as he can in the ſervice of Chriſt, but as little as he can in the ſervice of ſin. Thus alſo it was with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.7. <hi>So that ye come behind in no gift, waiting for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Their wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the coming of our Lord is brought in by <hi>Paul,</hi> as that which has a very effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cauſal Influence on the improvement of their gifts, in order to the ſervice of Chriſt. And what made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo vigorous and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſervice of Chriſt, but daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of his returne? So 1 Theſ. 2.19. <hi>For what is our hope, our joy, our crown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing? Are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his coming?</hi> That which made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo unwearied in his ſervice for Chriſt, among the Theſſalonians, was an eye fixed on the coming of Chriſt, and the Crown he ſhould then receive, for al his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. Such thoughts make us do much in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Laſtly a main part of our friendſhip with Chriſt conſiſts in an affectionate <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential</hi> remembrance of him in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and doth not the <hi>formal</hi> ſpirit hereof conſiſt in looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God?

Thus, according to the Platoniſt, <hi>Godlineſſe is a facultie of worſhipping God:</hi> and ſo the <hi>Stoics</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Godlineſſe was a Science of Worſhip due to the Gods.</hi> Whence a <hi>Godly man</hi> was, among the Grecians, <hi>one that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto, or worſhipped God.</hi> And indeed, that a main fundamental part of Godlineſſe conſiſteth in the ſanctifying Gods name in Worſhip is moſt evident; becauſe al preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Godlineſſe do moſtly concerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53798:79"/>about maters of worſhip.

                  <p n="1">(1.) We ſanctifie Gods name in Worſhip, when we abaſe our ſelves, and advance his name therein. Al eminence is worſhipt by an humble reverence and ſubmiſſion. Hence humble ſpirits are ever the fiteſt ſubjects for devotion. Now none raiſe God higher in their hearts, and depreſſe themſelves lower, than ſuch as daily expect the coming of their Lord. Oh! with what an humble reverence, and tremblement of heart do ſuch worſhip God? (2.) Again, we ſanctifie Gods name in worſhip, when we worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. A worſhip that hath not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward root and ſpring in the heart deſerves no better name than ſuperſtition. Our Lord tels us John 4.23. <hi>The true worſhippers are thoſe that worſhip the father in Spirit, and in truth.</hi> Formal devotion is but a kind of irreligion: Such duties are the devils <hi>galleries,</hi> not Chriſts: none worſhip God in <hi>truth,</hi> but ſuch as worſhip him in <hi>Spirit.</hi> And who worſhip God in ſpirit and truth more than ſuch, as daily expect the coming of their Lord?

Thus among the Grecians, <hi>a Godly man was one that converſed much, or had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Gods.</hi> Whence the more devote among the Heathens had their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſternia,</hi> or Beds,<note place="margin">Of theſe <hi>Lectiſternia</hi> ſee <hi>Court Gent.</hi> part 1.

O! what a rare inſtance of Godlineſſe is he, that has communion with God, not only in acts of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53798:81"/>immediate Worſhip, but alſo in the whole of his converſation? Many Chriſtians enjoy, at times, ſomewhat of God in duties; but then how ſoon do they loſe it again, after duties, by neglects, or not walking with God in their callings? But now a Soul that <hi>eyes, admires, adores, loves,</hi> and follows God, not only in Religious Ordinances, but alſo in commun <hi>providences, employments,</hi> and <hi>enjoyments,</hi> ſuch a man may be ſaid to walke with God, and to have attained more than ordinary ſtrains of Godlineſſe. And what has a greater influence and force to raiſe up the heart, to ſuch a ſtrain of heavenly converſation, or walking with God, than lively views of our approching Lord? Oh! how doth the glorie of Chriſts ſecond appearance, beheld by faith, winde up the ſoul to high raiſures of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him in this life? A Soul that ever lives in the believing views of Chriſts glorious appearing, <hi>ſees, hears, ſmels, taſtes, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> and <hi>enjoys</hi> nothing ſo much as Chriſt. How doth ſuch a ſoul, not only pray, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate; but alſo eat and drinke, walke, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, live and die in Chriſt? Is it not his whole buſineſſe to enjoy Chriſt? Doth he not make Chriſt his companion out of dutie, as wel as in dutie?

                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:53798:83"/>And this made him ſtudious, and ambitious to walke with and pleaſe God, by al manner of heavenly converſation: he obeyed and followed the various cals and Impreſſions of God: he retired from that ſenſual corrupt generation, and lived much alone with God: he enjoyed a true <hi>monaſtic</hi> life: the whole world was to him a <hi>Monaſterie,</hi> wherein he found ſolitude and retirement with God. Fiducial expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his approching Lord, gave him many ſublime and ſweet meditations, much pure light, and fervent love, many ſtrong deſires, and unwearied endeavors in walking with God. Oh! how were his Thoughts, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and Affections hereby moulded into a fit frame for walking with God? Believing, and lively expectations of our Lords approche have a ſoverain Influence on communion or walking with God, three ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) By enlarging the heart, and raiſing it above it ſelf. None are more filled with God, than thoſe who have their hearts moſt enlarged towards God. And O! how much is the heart enlarged towards God, by lively views of the coming of our Lord? To have raiſed expectations of our Lords approche, how doth it amplifie, and raiſe the ſoul above it ſelf? Is not this one of the nobleſt diſpoſitions in the new creature? As a Chriſtian in his loweſt condition far excels al other men; ſo when he lies under ſuch believing views of his Lords approche, how much doth he excel himſelf? Is he not, as it were, in another world? how enlarged are his deſires? what
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53798:83"/>elevated hopes has he? how wide and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is his whole ſoul for walking with God? Thus it was with the Spouſe, in the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; She was no ſooner eſpouſed to Chriſt, but he goes away, and reſides in heaven; and leave, her no other way for the enjoyment of him, but continued expectations, and ſtrong breathings after his return: and oh! how is her ſoul enlarged hereby in walking with God? So <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Make haſt,</hi> or <hi>flie away,</hi> &amp;c. She had an holy impatience, with Chriſtian ſubmiſſion, under his long abſence: So much was her heart enlarged in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of his returne. Such enlargement of heart, and communion with God had <hi>Paul,</hi> from the expectation of Chriſts returne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23, 24. <hi>We our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, this is the laſt word that the Church or Spirit in the Church breathes forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay come,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>John,</hi> v. 20. <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi> Thus the Primitive Churches had their hearts enlarged in long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the coming of our Lord: and thus they walked with God: ſeing they could not enjoy their Lord in perſon, they would in lively hopes and expectations of his returne.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Lively expectations of our Lords ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming have a prevalent influence on communion and walking with God, in that they keep God, and the ſoul together. Eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from God make a Schiſme in our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him: If you would keep God cloſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53798:84"/>to you, you muſt keep your hearts cloſe to God. A variable profeſſor, who ſtarteth away from God with every companie, is not fit to walke with God. And ſurely, nothing hath a greater force to keep the heart cloſe to God, than lively views of our Lords returne. What is it to have the heart kept cloſe to God, but to have it raiſed up to the Spirit and life of heaven? When the bodie is in the world, converſing with varietie of objects, even then to have the heart in heaven, this is that which I mean by having the heart kept cloſe to God, in al our ways. And what more effectual to keep the heart and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven, than dayly expectations of our Lords approche? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> walked with God,<note place="margin">Phil. 3 20.</note> as he aſſures us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Having ſpoken before of ſome, who made their belly their God, and were immerſed in earthly things, he ſubjoins: <hi>For our converſation is in heaven:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, our <hi>State, Citie, Trade, manner of life</hi> and <hi>converſation:</hi> The cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our thoughts, Inclinations, affections, and lives is in heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſhort: <hi>he walked with God.</hi> Ay, but what was it that engaged him hereto? That he addes: <hi>Whence alſo we look for the Saviour, our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Here lies the <hi>Spring,</hi> the root of his heavenly converſation, namely his looking for the coming of our Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) To walke with God is to follow God in al ways of <hi>Service, Suffering,</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> To obſerve what worke of ſervice, or ſuffering God cals us to, and to fal in with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53798:84"/>God in that worke. And what doth more effectually engage the heart hereto, than lively expectations of our Lords approche? Oh! how exact is ſuch a ſoul in obſerving every motion of Gods Spirit and Providence? What workings towards God hath it, agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the workings of God towards the ſoul? how flexible is it to turne this or that way, accordingly as God turnes towards it? Thus <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> walked with God.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Deep and affectionate expectations of the coming of our Lord have a Soverain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on <hi>Perſeverance in Grace;</hi> which is another fundamental part of Godlineſſe. A Godly man, being rooted in the covenant and in Chriſt, can never fal away <hi>finally,</hi> and <hi>totally.</hi> He may fal into ſin, but doth not, cannot continue in his fals: He may fal into a fit of ſlumber, as the Spouſe, but his heart waketh. The weakeſt believer at his loweſt ebbe keeps a radical union with Chriſt. Falſe hearts forſake Chriſt, when the comforts of Chriſt, or of the world forſake them: But Godly perſons cannot forſake Chriſt, albeit he may ſeem to forſake them. A man that is once truely Godly is ever ſo. God hath put this divine qualitie into the nature of <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> Grace, beyond that of <hi>Adam,</hi> that it keeps mans mutable wil, in an immutable ſtate of Grace. In other ſtates men come to ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by degrees, but in the ſtate of Grace a Godly man hath it at firſt daſh, and that from the Spirits indwelling. Now a main Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53798:85"/>which the <hi>Spirit</hi> uſeth to keep the Saints in perſeverance, is daily expectation of our Lords returne. O! what more effectual to keep the heart from ſecret, as wel as open backſlidings, than freſh views of our Lords approche? Thus <hi>Jud.</hi> 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercie of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto Eternal life.</hi> This alſo kept <hi>Paul tite</hi> and conſtant, in his Chriſtian race, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. Alas! what is it that makes many carnal profeſſors turne their back on Chriſt, and plunge their ſouls in al manner of ſenſualities, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting far off the coming of their Lord? This ſeems to have given occaſion unto <hi>Peter,</hi> of this warme diſcourſe, touching the coming of our Lord, his foreſeeing there would ariſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny looſe profeſſors, in theſe days, who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting far from them the coming of the day of God, would fal into al manner of ſenſualitie and profaneſſe, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. What thinke you? Would <hi>Judas</hi> have been ſo baſe-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to ſel his maſter for thirty pieces of Silver, had he expected his ſecond coming? Can we imagine that <hi>Demas</hi> would have been ſo ſordid, as to leave the ſervice of Chriſt, and turne again to this preſent world, had he kept the coming of his Lord in his eye? No ſurely. Ah! is not this the bitter root of al Apoſtaſie, in theſe laſt days, ſecure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors dream not of their Lords approche?</p>

                  <p>As for the Root of al ſecond-table duties, or holy converſation towards men, it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by our Lord, in <hi>Love to our neighbor,</hi> Mat. 22.39.

And there

Alas! were it poſſible, that Saints, who lie under ſo many <hi>eſſential,</hi> and deep obligations to love each other, could keep at ſuch a diſtance as they do, had they the coming of their Lord much in their eye? It was the <hi>ſaying</hi> of a great Divine now with God, That the <hi>Diviſions in the Church, are a greater plague, than the raging ſword.</hi> And whence ſpring al theſe diviſions, but from our diviſion from God?

In a circle, the nearer the lines come to the centre, the nearer they come each to other: ſo here, the more we look for, and the nearer we approche to the coming of the day of God, the nearer we ſhal approche each to other, by brotherly love, union, and communion.

Neither doth this expectation of our Lords approche worke in the Saints love to each other only, but alſo love to al mankind.

So much for the <hi>principe</hi> and <hi>root</hi> of al holy converſation, namely Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian love, which is the bond of perfection. I now procede to ſome particular branches or parts of this holy converſation, with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to demonſtrate, what Influence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from a fiducial looking for, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening to the coming of the day of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One main part of an holy converſation, as to men, conſiſteth in an irreprochable and blameleſſe courſe of righteouſneſſe: when Chriſtians fil up every <hi>Relation, Capacitie, Condition, Opportunitie,</hi> and <hi>dutie</hi> God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts them with: when men performe the duties of their place, in their proper place. Such Chriſtians do by their <hi>Actions</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth of their <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Their <hi>deeds,</hi> as wel as their <hi>words,</hi> are a good Apologie for what they profeſſe: and when men cannot judge concerning their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yet they may, and do judge of their holy practice and converſation. Now what more efficacious to produce ſuch an <hi>irreprocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and righteous converſation, than ſerious expectations of our Lords approche? This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo conſcientious and exact in his

                     </gap>, <hi>propter hoc,</hi> i.e. by reaſon of this Confidence, touching the Reſurrection, at the coming of our Lord, <hi>Paul</hi> did exerciſe himſelf in al conſcientious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard towards God and men. This is the life of al <hi>pietie</hi> towards God, the nerves of al commun juſtice towards men, and <hi>ſobrictie</hi> towards our ſelves. Thus Tit. 2.12.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>That we ſhould live ſoberly,</hi> [i.e. in reference to our ſelves] <hi>righteouſly,</hi> [which refers to others] and <hi>godly,</hi> [which reſpecteth God.] And al this is grounded on, v. 13. <hi>Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another part of an holy converſation conſiſts in Chriſtian moderation towards al men; which is the proper effect of Love. A Chriſtian ſhould be moſt ſevere towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but exceding moderate as to others. Our bleſſed Lord inſtructeth us, both by his exemple and precept, that there is not a more evident marque of a generous heroic ſpirit,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53798:89"/>than, in al humilitie and ſubmiſſion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to the Infirmities of others, by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian moderation. This <hi>moderation,</hi> which is ſo eſſential to an holy converſation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it ſeveral Ingredients. I ſhal only mention ſuch as receive a peculiar Influence from a ſerious looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God. That daily expectation of our Lords approche has a very ſoverain influence on Chriſtian moderation, is evident from that exhortation of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 4.5.</note> Philip. 4.5. <hi>Let your moderation be known unto al men; the Lord is at hand.</hi> Some among the <hi>Philippians</hi> were, as it ſeems, from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. too <hi>tenacious,</hi> and ſtiffe, as to their own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and opinions: The <hi>Philippians</hi> were very affectionate Chriſtians, but wanted knowlege and jugement, as it appears from, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. Their love was ardent, but not ſo judicious as it ought to be: and ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Chriſtians are moſt prone to excede in <hi>intemperate, immoderate</hi> zele. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> here exhorts them to <hi>Moderation,</hi> not only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſtians, but to al men: and what argument doth he urge, to induce them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? That follows: <hi>The Lord is at hand.</hi> The grand motive, from which he enforceth his exhortation, is the coming of our Lord. But I deſcend to particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Serious expectation of the coming of our Lord hath a ſpecial efficace on moderation in <hi>Jugement,</hi> and <hi>opinions.</hi> Its no ſmal piece of Immoderation, and Intemperance, too commun among many profeſſors, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53798:89"/>our own private <hi>Dogmes</hi> and opinions, no way <hi>eſſential,</hi> or <hi>fundamental</hi> to ſaving faith, as a rule of faith on others. This ſeems to have been the caſe of ſome among the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians;</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts to moderation herein, and that from this ground, Phil. 3.15. <hi>if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhal revele even this unto you.</hi> And, oh! what a prevalence has a ſerious expectation of our Lords ſecond coming, to keep profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors from the Impoſition of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, as a rule of faith on others? Such as daily look for this great day, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow, yet they durſt not by force lead, or rule others: perhaps they cannot embrace the ſentiments of others, yet they dare not impoſe their own, as a rule of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Another piece of Chriſtian modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts in <hi>Toleration,</hi> or forbearance of others, as to injuries done unto us. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an love is exceding meek and <hi>paſſive:</hi> It can <hi>ſuffer</hi> much injurie, without the leaſt <hi>Reaction,</hi> ſpecially when it hath the coming of the day of God in its eye. What makes men ſo <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive</hi> and impatient under injuries received, but putting far from them the approche of their Lord? So Mat. 24.48, 49. <hi>But and if that evil ſervant ſhal ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming; and ſhal begin to ſmite his fellow ſervants,</hi> &amp;c. Here you ſee the cauſe why the evil ſervant ſmiteth his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervants, is becauſe <hi>he ſays in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming.</hi> What made the rigorous ſervant ſo ſevere in exacting the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53798:90"/>hundred pence, due from his fellow ſervant, but a groundleſſe perſuaſion, that his Lord would not cal him to an account for the ten thouſand Talents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Serious thoughts of our Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche are exceeding efficacious to keep men from uncharitable cenſures, which is another part of Chriſtian moderation, wherein much of an holy converſation doth conſiſt. Oh! what a ſevere cenſorious ſpirit have many profeſſors? whiles they blame and cenſure others, how juſtly do they fal under the blame, and cenſure of uncharitable ſeveritie? Yea, how rigid are ſome in their cenſures of other mens rigidneſſes? Yea, are not many, who are moſt indulgent as to their own fauts, moſt ſevere in cenſuring the fauts of others? And if their actions are good, yet how prone are they to cenſure their Intentions? And whence ſpringeth this unchriſtian ſeveritie, but from a want of regard to the coming of our Lord? This ſeems to have been the ſin of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, which <hi>Paul</hi> cautions them againſt, 1 Cor. 4.5.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who wil both bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and wil make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts.</hi> The Corinthians were broken into many parties, and each partie was prone to judge, and cenſure the different partie. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives check to theſe cenſorious humors: and what argument doth he uſe? ſurely, no other than the coming of our Lord, and that univerſal Jugement which would enſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:53798:90"/> (4.) Another piece of Chriſtian modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts in freedome from ſecret <hi>Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, grudges,</hi> and envies againſt others. Some profeſſors are ſo <hi>intemperate</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate</hi> in their pretended zele, or rather <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> that albeit they have nothing they can or durſt cenſure others for, yet what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret grudges, animoſities, and envyings do they loge in their breſts againſt them? And what better remedie can there be againſt ſuch diſtempered, immoderate paſſion, than lively expectation of our Lords approche? Thus Jam. 5.9. <hi>Grudge not one againſt another,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>brethren, leſt ye be condemned: behold the judge ſtandeth at the dore.</hi> He had mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the foregoing verſe, the <hi>drawing nigh of the Lord,</hi> and then addes this as an <hi>appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> thereto, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ſend not forth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret groans each againſt other.</hi> By <hi>grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>groaning,</hi> he underſtandeth a certain <hi>inteſtine</hi> complaint, or invidious clamor of ſpirit; which argueth much impatience, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it breaketh not forth, by reaſon of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that may hinder. Some interpret it, <hi>Envie not each other;</hi> becauſe envie is wont to <hi>grudge,</hi> or <hi>groan</hi> at the good of others. It is thought to refer to the ſtorie of <hi>Cain;</hi> to whom God ſaid, when he envied his Brother, Gen. 4.6. <hi>Why art thou wroth?</hi> i. e. why doeſt thou <hi>grudge,</hi> or groan againſt thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Ay, but what argument doth <hi>James</hi> bring to kil this viper of invidious groaning, or grudging each againſt other? that follows: <hi>Behold the judge ſtandeth at the dore.</hi> Oh!
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53798:91"/>what a ſoverain <hi>Antidote</hi> is this, againſt the venimous root of invidious grudging againſt others, to think, that the judge ſtandeth at the dore? Alas! whence ſpringeth al envie, and grudging, but from this narrow ſelfiſh conceit, that another man enjoys the good, that I want, and ought to have? Now a ſerious ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lively view of the coming of our Lord, makes us look upon what good others enjoy, as if it were our own: and doth not this take away the root, and ground of al envie? A Saint that daily waits for the coming of his Lord, looks on the Gifts and Graces of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that which doth as effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his chiefeſt good, namely the ſervice of his Lord, as if they were his own; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, ſo far as he is ſpiritual, he doth rejoice in them, as if they were really inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſo far is he from envying or grudging at the gifts and Graces of others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Fiducial views of our Lords approche have an efficacious Influence on Chriſtian <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> and <hi>Admonition;</hi> which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther main part of an holy Converſation. The love we owe to our brethren obligeth us to admoniſh them of ſin, and exhort them to dutie. Yea, love to our ſelves engageth us to admoniſh others of their ſin. To be either afraid or aſhamed of reproving ſin is an hainous ſin: Not to reprove our brother for ſin, is a great piece of crueltie both to him and our ſelves, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. Now daily waiting for the coming of our Lord, is a very forcible motive to provoke men unto the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53798:91"/>of this dutie. Thus Heb. 10.25. <hi>

If we conſider Chriſt under his <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mediatorie relation,</hi> as to Saints and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the looking for, and haſtening to his ſecond coming muſt needs be very influenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhal here only conſider Chriſts general Mediatorie Relation to Saints and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as he is the <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> of both; the conſideration whereof renders our looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of the day of God very Influential, on al ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to raiſe them up to al manner of holy Converſation and Godlineſſe. That al Juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is commited to Chriſt, by the Father, is evident, from ſeveral prophetic Characters of Chriſts coming to judge to the world in the old
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53798:94"/>Teſtament. So Pſal. 96.10. <hi>he ſhal judge the people righteouſly.</hi> The like Pſal. 98.9. <hi>For he cometh to judge the earth,</hi> &amp;c. with varietie of other Scriptures, which mention the laſt jugement. For the underſtanding of which we have this general rule given by <hi>Jackson,</hi> and other learned men; <q>That al thoſe places of Scripture in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which intimate either a new manner of Gods governing the World; or a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reign over al Nations; or of being made Lord and King; or of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to judge the earth, muſt be underſtood of Chriſt, as God-man: who by virtue of his death and Reſurrection, became Lord of althings, and ſo judge of quick and dead, by a peculiar Title and perſonal right.</q> This is more fully expreſſed by our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who in his Sermons and diſcourſes with the Jews, did but expound and comment on thoſes text of Scriptures, which he had before uttered by the mouths of his Prophets. Thus, John 5.22. <hi>For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed al jugement to the Son.</hi> So Act. 10.42. <hi>And he commanded us to Preach unto the people, and to teſtifie, that it is he who was ordained of God, to be judge of the quick, and dead.</hi> Thus 2 Tim. 4.1. <hi>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhal judge the quick and the dead at his appearing.</hi> The like 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.5. Now al mankind ſtanding in this relation to Chriſt, as their ſupreme Judge, it cannot be, but that the ſerious looking for, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53798:95"/>haſtening to the ſecond coming of Chriſt muſt needs have a ſoverain Influence on mens hearts and lives. At preſent, Chriſts <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie</hi> Kingdome and Glorie lies veiled and darkened; but at Chriſts ſecond coming there wil a viſible glorie, and Majeſtie attend his Throne of Jugement; the conſideration whereof cannot but ſtartle, and overawe the ſtouteſt ſinners, when under the apprehenſions thereof. Oh! what <hi>tremblements</hi> of ſpirit; what violent rendings and horrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience have many awakened ſinners, whiles under lively apprehenſions of Chriſts ſecond coming to judge the world? What made <hi>Cain, Judas, Felix,</hi> with other debauched ſinners, ſo much to tremble under the ſenſe of their ſin, but the conſideration of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to judge the world? There are two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in Chriſts final Jugement, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which render our looking for, and haſtening to that great day very influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The day of Jugement wil be a day of <hi>manifeſtation:</hi> al the ſecret hidden things of darkeneſſe wil then be brought to light. And Oh! what a powerful conſideration is this, to influence the hearts and lives of ſuch, as daily expect the coming of our Lord? What made the promulgation of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> ſo terrible,<note place="margin">Exod. 19 16, 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16, 17, 18. but that it was a day of manifeſtation? Yea, we are told, Heb. 12.21. <hi>And ſo terrible was the ſight, that</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, I excedingly fear and quake.</hi> And whence ſprang this great
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53798:95"/>pannic fear, which ſurpriſed <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt of the Jews, at the delivery of the Law, but from the ſenſe they had of their own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſerable ſtate, upon the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law gave them? Hence <hi>Jackson</hi> makes the Terrors on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> types of thoſe terrors, which ſhal ſurpriſe ſinners at the laſt jugement. O! then, what a great and terrible day of manifeſtation wil that be? and how doth the forethoughts hereof affect awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened ſouls? What! ſay ſuch, wil my Lord ere long come to judge the World? And muſt al my, ſecret luſts, thoughts, and actions be then reveled? Oh! what mean I then thus to indulge my ſelf in ſin? What a fool am I thus to treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath? This was the ſum and concluſion of <hi>Solomons</hi> Sermon, Eccleſ. 12.13.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the whole mater: fear God, and keep his Commandements; for this is the whole dutie of man. Solomon</hi> here cloſeth up his experimental diſcourſe, touching the vanitie of the creature, with this great concluſion; which, ſaith he, <hi>is the whole dutie of man,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the whole man,</hi> i. e. <hi>that which concernes the whole man.</hi> Ay, but what doth he ground his exhortation on? That fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, v. 14. <hi>For God ſhal bring every worke into jugement, with every ſecret thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> O! ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> remember, that al your ſecret va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, pride, wantonneſſes, with other luſts, ſhal be brought into Jugement, at the coming of our Lord, and this conſideration wil
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53798:96"/>ſtrongly oblige you to <hi>fear God,</hi> and <hi>keep his commandments.</hi> Upon the like account the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both wil bring to light the hidden things of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and wil make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts: and then ſhal every man have praiſe of God.</hi> As if he had ſaid: <q>Alas! how comes it to paſſe, that ye are ſo cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, in judging me at preſent? Are not things now much in the darke? can't you tarrie awhile, 'til our ſupreme Judge come, who wil then bring to light al the hidden things of darkneſſe?</q> Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13. bids them take heed what materials they built on Chriſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, becauſe <hi>every mans worke ſhal be made manifeſt: for the day ſhal declare it,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>day,</hi> we may underſtand the day of Chriſt's coming to judge the world, which wil be a great day of Revelation, and Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You know a clear diſcoverie of the <hi>fact,</hi> is a neceſſary <hi>antecedent</hi> to a righteous jugement: And, oh! what a diſcoverie wil there be of the hidden things of darkeneſſe? Wil not then al Gods books and records be brought forth and manifeſted? How clearly wil the book of the Law be underſtood? How manifeſt wil al the records of Conſcience be in that day? What a World of ſecret ſins wil the book of Gods omniſcience then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? How impoſſible wil it be for any ſecret hypocrite to concele his ſin in that day? At
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53798:96"/>preſent, many refined hypocrites have got the Skil and Art of conceling their ſecret luſts, not only from the world, but their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences alſo. There are <hi>myſteries of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and deeds of darkneſſe, which never yet ſaw the Sun; yea, which the ſinner himſelf peradventure is not conſcious of: Ay, but ſinner; how wilt thou be able to concele thy ſin, at the revelation of our ſupreme Judge; when he ſhal come, and rip open thine heart, and bring to jugement al thy ſecret ſins? How wil thine heart be able to bear the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and heat of that fiery trial, at our Lords appearing? So alſo in regard of the Saints, that day wil manifeſt al their ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of darkneſſe, both good and evil: and oh! how much doth the conſideration hereof influence their hearts and lives in this day of Grace?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The conſideration of Chriſts coming to judge the world makes our expectation of his ſecond coming very Influential, in as much as that day ſhal be a day of <hi>Recompences,</hi> and <hi>Retributions</hi> to every man according to his workes. In this world we al have our day of labor and worke: every man living has ſome worke which he deſignes to finiſh. The righteous, they worke in the fire of much tribulation, that at laſt they may find refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the preſence of the Lord. The wicked they alſo work, and toyl hard in this their day of time. Oh! what drudges are they of Satan, and every baſe luſt? And as both have their working day, ſo alſo their day
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53798:97"/>of Recompences, at the ſecond coming of our Lord. So Luke 14.14. <hi>For thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the reſurrection of the juſt, i. e.</hi> at the coming of the day of God. When mens labors end, their recompences begin:<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.6, 7.</note> ſo here; as 2 Theſ. 1.6. <hi>ſeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompenſe tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them that trouble you.</hi> 7. <hi>And to you that are troubled reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhal be reveled from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi> The Revelation of our Lord from Heaven is the day of recompences; becauſe then al men ceaſe from their workes of time. Neither is it only a day of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in general, but alſo of retribution unto every man, according to his workes. Thus much is implied in that firſt notion: <hi>ſeing it is a righteous thing with God.</hi> What is the formal notion <hi>of a righteous thing,</hi> but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto every one according to his deſerts, or what is his own? Thence alſo it follows: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to recompenſe.</hi> The word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies, to give unto every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he hath done. So that ſhould not God recompenſe unto every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his workes, he would not be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; which to conceive of the holy God is no leſſe than blaſphemie. God, who is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, cannot but recompenſe to al according to their workes: elſe he would not be God. So Eſa. 3.10. <hi>Say ye unto the righteous, that it ſhal be wel with him: For they ſhal eat the fruit of their doings.</hi> 11. <hi>Wo unto the wicked, it ſhal be il with him: For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2 5, 6, 11.</note> Thus Rom. 2.5. <hi>and revelation of the righteous jugement of God.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Who wil render unto every man according to his deeds:</hi> and he gives the reaſon of al, v. 11. <hi>For there is no reſpect of perſons with God.

                     <hi>Be not deceived God is not mocqued: For
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53798:98"/>whatſoever a man ſowes, that ſhal he alſo reap. Be not deceived,</hi> i. e. deceive not your ſelves: delude not your own ſouls by fallacious fond preſumtions, and conceits. <hi>God is not mocqued,</hi> &amp;c. Should carnal ſecure ſinners, who ſow to the fleſh, reap life everlaſting, how would God be derided and mocqued by them? But the holy God wil not be mocqued. They that ſow tares muſt not expect to reap wheat: Such as ſow to the fleſh ſhal reap wrath and damnation. Again, ſhould not God recompenſe to his people according to their workes and ſufferings, God would be alſo mocqued by wicked men, in that al the workes of his troubled Saints were in vain. But <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. that <hi>their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor is not in vain,</hi> which he expounds, 1 Cor. 3.8. <hi>every man ſhal receive his own reward according to his own labor.</hi> By which it is moſt evident, that Chriſt wil, at laſt day, recompenſe to every man according to his workes.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth this at al make for <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or <hi>Juſtification by works,</hi> as the Papiſts would needs perſuade us. For (1.) The Reward which God confers on believers is not <hi>For,</hi> but <hi>According</hi> to their good workes. It is <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>according to,</hi> not <hi>for his deeds. Good works</hi> are not the <hi>meritorious cauſe,</hi> but the <hi>evidence,</hi> by which God meſures their evangelic ſinceritie and perfection. It is impoſſible for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to merit any thing in a proper ſenſe; becauſe there can be no mutual obligation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53798:98"/>the creature, and the Creator; or any thing given to God, which bears proportion with the good things of eternal life, which he confers on us. Indeed were our good workes perfect, yet they could purchaſe nothing from God by way of merit; becauſe they are but the fruit of his own Grace; neither do we give unto God but what is his due. But alas! the beſt workes under Heaven are ſo far from meriting any good from God, as that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſinfulneſſe, they demerit wrath and damnation. Hence,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Recompence which God gives unto believers, according to their good workes, is properly a <hi>Gift,</hi> and metaphoricly only a Reward. Al the proportion or regard which our good workes have to the reward, given according thereunto, flowes merely from the <hi>evangelic conſtitution,</hi> and promiſſe, not from any inherent worthe in the workes themſelves. So that although it be a day of Jugement, yet it is alſo a day of Grace, as to the rewards given to believers: There is not more of juſtice, than of free-grace in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſtributed. So Rom. 6.23. <hi>But the gift of God is eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Albeit Chriſt allows a place to <hi>workes</hi> in the laſt Jugement, yet he wil not allow them the leaſt place, or mention in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juſtification, thereby to exclude al <hi>boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. There wil be no danger of boaſting in the believers being judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes, becauſe his good workes are produced, not as the <hi>principal
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53798:99"/>ground</hi> of his acceptance, but only as an <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of his ſinceritie, and evangelic perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As faith is the <hi>federal Inſtrument,</hi> that juſtifies his perſon, ſo good workes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the laſt jugement, as that which wil juſtifie his faith, and Gods former juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him before the world.<note place="margin">Jam. 2.12.</note> So Jam. 2.12. <hi>ſo ſpeake ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhal be judged by the law of libertie.</hi> The <hi>law of libertie,</hi> by which men ſhal be judged at laſt day, is the <hi>Moral Law Evangeliſed;</hi> which ſhal judge, not according to the rigor of the firſt Covenant, but according to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic conſtitution of the New Covenant, which accepts faith and ſinceritie in lieu of perfect obedience.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) In the laſt jugement Chriſt wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, even with believers, according to their workes; becauſe then they are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with wicked men. For to vindicate the equitie of Gods procedings with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is neceſſary, that the Evangelic obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of believers be brought forth in juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which wil ſtop the mouths of al un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, and vindicate Chriſt from that falſe Imputation of having reſpect to mens perſons, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11. But now in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juſtification of believers, the compariſon is not with unbelievers; but they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with themſelves, and the law of God; that ſo ſeeing the Imperfection and pollution of their beſt workes, they may abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their own righteouſneſſes and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and flie to Chriſt for refuge. So that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53798:99"/>ſhould <hi>good workes</hi> have the leaſt room here, the whole deſign of Juſtification by Chriſts righteouſneſſe would be fruſtated and made void.</p>
                  <p>Now this being made evident, that Chriſt, at his ſecond coming, wil judge al men according to their workes, the conſideration hereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have a prevalent influence on al ſuch, as by faith look for, and haſten to the coming of the Day of God. I ſhal only adde one text, which indeed ſhould worke a dread and terror in us al, namely, Mat. 12.36, 37.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.36, 27.</note> 
                     <hi>But I ſay unto you, That every idle word, that men ſhal ſpeak, they ſhal give account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the day of Jugement. For by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> By <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Idle word,</hi> we muſt underſtand, (1.) Every emty vain word, that hath not its due ſoliditie, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and weight. (2.) Every <hi>unprofitable word,</hi> which has not ſome <hi>conducence,</hi> and <hi>tendence</hi> to the honor and glorie of God. (3.) The whole <hi>converſation.</hi> For if we are to give an account of every idle word, then ſurely, by a paritie of reaſon, of al other parts of our converſation. And oh! what a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſideration is this, to al thoſe, who wait for the coming of their Lord, to labor after al manner of holy converſation, and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? What! ſaith ſuch an expectant ſoul, doth my judge ſtand at the dore? as <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.9. and muſt I ſhortly render an account to him, of every idle word?

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53798:100"/>manner of righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe? So much for Chriſts general relation to al as Judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we conſider Chriſts ſpecial media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie Relations to Saints, theſe cannot but be exceding influential on ſuch, as by faith daily look for and haſten to the coming of the day of God. Chriſt, out of his rich, free, and condeſcendent love, has brought himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many affectionate and efficacious relations, the conſideration of which is exceding obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, and influential on ſuch as wait for his ſecond coming, in order to al manner of holy Converſation and Godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Chriſt is the Believers Savior; and therefore the looking for, and haſtening to his ſecond coming cannot but leave a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent influence and engagement on their hearts, to labor after the higheſt pitches of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

Away, away my ſoul, to meet thy Savior! where ſhould thy heart, and converſation be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53798:100"/>but where thy treaſure, thy Savior is? No wonder indeed, that <hi>Paul</hi> had his converſation in Heaven, ſeing thence he looked for his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>And to them that look for him, ſhal he appear the ſecond time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, unto ſalvation.</hi> The conſideration of Chriſts ſecond appearance unto ſalvation, is of great force, to ſuch as look for the ſame, in order to an holy converſation, and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The like <hi>Jude</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Relation which believers bear to Chriſt as their Husband, hath a ſoverain efficace on thoſe that look for his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wind up their Spirits to al manner of holy converſation and Godlineſſe. One main eſſential part of conjugal friendſhip conſiſteth in the daily expectation of our abſent relation: and the more lively thoughts the Wife has of her approching Husband, the more wil ſhe prepare herſelf to entertain him, when he comes. Oh! what a prevalent motive and argument is Chriſts conjugal relation, to draw forth the hearts of his Spouſe daily to look for, and haſten to his ſecond coming? Theſe are the laſt breathings of the Church in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Rev. 22.17. <hi>and the Spirit and the Bride ſay come,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Spirit in the Bride.</hi> And what more effectual to worke up the believers heart and life to the higheſt raiſures of Godlineſſe, and holy converſation, than the lively expectation of Chriſt as their husband? How ſoon would ſuch thoughts diſpel al adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous thoughts and Affections towards the Idols of this World?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:53798:101"/> (3.) Chriſt is related to believers as their <hi>Head,</hi> which addes much to the Influence, their looking for his ſecond coming has on an holy converſation and Godlineſſe. As a bodie is either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>politic;</hi> ſo an <hi>Head:</hi> and Chriſt is held forth in Scripture under both theſe capacities. He is as the <hi>natural</hi> head, in regard of <hi>Influence;</hi> and as a <hi>politic</hi> Head, in regard of governement, to his Church. Believers receive al gracious <hi>Influences</hi> from Chriſt, as the natural bodie al animal Spirits from the <hi>Head;</hi> as alſo al Laws and diſcipline, as <hi>politic</hi> bodies do from their Rulers. So Eph. 4.15, 16. <hi>Which is the head even Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. Now Chriſt being thus the <hi>Head,</hi> both as to <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Governement,</hi> of his Church, how much doth this <hi>oblige</hi> believers, who expect his ſecond coming, to preſſe after al manner of holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſſe? Alas! whence hath the member <hi>ſenſe, motion,</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> but from its <hi>Head?</hi> And doth not this oblige it to converſe with, and ſubmit unto its head in althings? And doth not the believers relation to Chriſt, as his Head, much more oblige him to look for, and thence to conforme unto Chriſt in althings?</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Chriſt is held forth in Scripture as the very <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of Believers, he being the ſame to them that the ſoul is to the bodie. So Lament. 4.20.<note place="margin">Lam. 4.20.</note> 
                     <hi>The breath of our noſtrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits,</hi> &amp;c. Though this may have ſome regard to <hi>Zedekiah</hi> as the type, yet it chiefly refers
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53798:101"/>to Chriſt, who is the breath of our noſtrils, <hi>i. e.</hi> our <hi>life.</hi> So Gal. 2.20. <hi>Not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Chriſt is to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul the ſame, that the ſoul is to the bodie. Now this conſideration, that Chriſt is the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of the New creature, muſt needs have a very powerful and Soverain influence on al ſuch as wait for his ſecond coming. Thus, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. For ye are <hi>dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.3, 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>and your life is hid with God in Chriſt. Our life is hid with God in Chriſt,</hi> as in the <hi>Root, Spring,</hi> and <hi>Fountain;</hi> but it ſhal be manifeſt at the appearance of our Lord. So it follows: <hi>When Chriſt, who is our life, ſhal appear, then ſhal ye alſo appear with him in glorie. When Chriſt, who is our life:</hi> i. e. as the ſoul is the life of the bodie, ſo is Chriſt of the ſoul. The ſoul gives to the bodie <hi>life</hi> and al the <hi>iſſues</hi> thereof, as <hi>health, vigor, ſenſe, growth, perfection, operation,</hi> &amp;c. So doth Chriſt to the ſoul. And what concluſion doth <hi>Paul</hi> draw from this, that when Chriſt, who is our life, ſhal appear, we ſhal appear with him in glorie? That follows: v. 5. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie therefore your earthly members,</hi> &amp;c. So that this conſideration, that Chriſt who is our life ſhal ere long appear is mightie influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential on ſuch as look for him.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) There are ſeveral other relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and believers, the conſideration of which is mighty efficacious on ſuch as daily expect his ſecond coming. Is not Chriſt the Vine, and are not they the branches? Is not Chriſt the advocate, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53798:102"/>are not they guilty malefactors? What are they but ſick patients; and what is Chriſt but the great Soul-Phyſician? O! what a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Sheepherd is Chriſt; and what poor infirme Sheep are believers? What a wiſe compaſſionate Father is Chriſt, to ſuch diſobedient and froward Children as believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are? Was there ever found ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Lord and Maſter as Chriſt is, to ſuch unfaithful ſervants as we are? Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe intimate relations, which Chriſt has to believers, are of great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on ſuch as expect his ſecond coming: What! ſay ſuch, is my <hi>Soul-Phyſician,</hi> my great <hi>Sheepherd,</hi> my <hi>Father,</hi> my <hi>Lord</hi> ſo near in coming, and ſhal I be ſo far behind in my preparation for him? Muſt I hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter live forever with him, and ſhal I now live no more unto him? Oh! What means this difformitie and diſtance from my great Lord and Father who is ſo near to me?</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WE now procede to the <hi>ſecond</hi> branch of our <hi>third Queſtion,</hi> namely, <hi>What there is in Sinners, and Saints, which renders their looking for the ſecond coming of Chriſt ſo Influential,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are ſome <hi>commun principles, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> in ſinners, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their looking for the coming of our Lord very efficacious. (1.) Al ſinners have more or leſſe ſome commun notions of a future ſtate. There are ſome notions of good and evil, naturally implanted in mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: as the notions of truth and falſhood. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. The Gentiles are ſaid <hi>to be a Law unto themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtles propoſition is univerſally true; which argues they were not without ſome apprehenſions of a future ſtate, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth the good, and puniſheth the evil. (2.) They have alſo a natural inbred remote Inclination towards future happineſſe, with an averſation as to approching miſerie. (3.) Theſe commun notions and inbred Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are oft much heightened by the acceſſe of Evangelic Illuminations. (4.) The <hi>Spirit</hi> of Bondage frequently comes, and addes much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53798:103"/>more light and heat, unto natural and awakened Conſciences. (5.) Yea, ſometimes uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinners obtain a taſte of the <hi>Heavenly gift,</hi> and of <hi>the powers of the world to come,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. Now theſe commun notions, Inclinations, and diſpoſitions, ſpecially when they are al in conjunction, cannot but have a powerful Influence on awakened ſinners, ſuch as look for the coming of our Lord. Oh! what ſtrange convulſions and horrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience have ſome fallen under? what a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Crucifixion</hi> to the World, and <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of luſt have they attained unto? How far have they gone in partial Reformation, and Conformitie to the Laws of Chriſt? Yea, what commun taſtes have they had of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching glories, by virtue of theſe commun <hi>notions,</hi> and <hi>Illuminations</hi> of the Spirit, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with a ſerious expectation of their coming Lord? This ſeems to have been the caſe of ſome illuminated Jews, of whom we find mention, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. They had not only ſome natural notions, but moreover commun illuminations, and taſtes of the Heavenly gift: Yea, they were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> had ſome tranſient and commun touches, ſome imperfect worke of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ay, but whence ſprang al this? That follows, v. 5. <hi>And have taſted the good word of God,</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> Evangelic tidings of ſalvation by Chriſt] <hi>and the powers of the World to come,</hi> i. e. the ſuavities of thoſe good things, that ſhal be reveled at the coming of our Lord. The ſum of al ſeems this: The Spirit of God
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53798:103"/>wrought in them ſome great illuminations and diſcoveries of the coming of the day of God, which gave them labial taſtes of the Heavenly Gift, and brought them under a great meſure of partial <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Renovation</hi> of heart and life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Saints have ſome peculiar princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and diſpoſitions in them, which render their looking for the coming of our Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding influential.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Believers have a <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which is ſuited unto the coming of the day of God, and al thoſe good things then to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And this makes the expectation of our Lords coming exceding efficacious. There is no diſpoſition ſo <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually natural</hi> to the <hi>new</hi> creature, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual looking for the coming of our Lord. Hence the daily exercice hereof cannot but be of great force, for the improvement of al holy Converſation and Godlineſſe. Believers nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, nor ſpeake, nor act, nor live as they ought, longer then they mind the coming of their Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Saints have a <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> dwelling in them, which addes a prevalent Influence to the looking for the coming of their Lord. The Spirit of Adoption reſiding in Believers, is an earneſt of al thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enjoyments, which ſhal be reveled at the coming of our Lord: and oh! what a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain force doth their looking for the coming of the day of God receive hence, for the improvement of al manner of Godlineſſe and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53798:104"/>holy Converſation? Thus Rom. 8.23. <hi>Our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> reſiding in believers, as the <hi>principle</hi> of their life and <hi>Grace,</hi> is, not only the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of approching Glorie, but alſo a powerful ſpring, which inclines the heart, by ineffable groans, to move towards our approching Lord; whereby the heart is fortified, and drawen forth in al manner of holy converſation and Godlineſſe. This Spirit of Adoption thus dwelling and acting in believers, doth, by lively views of our Lords coming, worke up the heart to great elevations of Grace and holineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Saints have in them a <hi>principle</hi> of Divine ſaith, which hath a great correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with, and Influence on their looking for the coming of the day of God, in order to an holy converſation and Godlineſſe. O! what an intimate cognation hath faith, with the coming of our Lord? and how much is Godlineſſe improved by believing ſights of that great day? where ever we find any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar promiſſes made to a particular condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or frame of Spirit, there faith, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed on ſuch promiſſes, receives a peculiar Influence: Now looking for the coming of the day of God, hath many ſpecial promiſſes made to it, which faith improves and draws influence from, in order to a holy converſation and Godlineſſe. Thus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Paul</hi> brings in <hi>the love</hi> of Chriſts appearing, as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53798:104"/>the main condition of the Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. The <hi>looking for Chriſts coming,</hi> is made the condition of his <hi>appearing the ſecond time, without ſin, unto ſalvation.</hi> And in the general, I do not find any one frame of ſpirit, which has more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar promiſſes made to it, than this of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and haſtening to the coming of our Lord. Now then faith finding on record ſuch ſpecial promiſſes, made to this looking for our Lords approche, hence it derives ſpecial <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Influences;</hi> whereby it is much <hi>raiſed, quickened,</hi> and <hi>fortified</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of al manner of holy converſation and Godlineſſe. Special promiſſes entitle us unto ſpecial privileges, bleſſings, and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, upon the performance of the condition annexed to them. And the main worke of faith is, to ſucke and draw forth the juice and marrow of theſe promiſſes in order to the Divine life.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) A Saint has a ſtrong <hi>Bent</hi> of heart, with a great quantitie of ſpiritual Affections, which are al ſuited to the coming of the day of God; and being exerciſed thereon draw thence ſoverain Influences, for the promoting of an holy Converſation and Godlineſſe. What more agreable to the Saints deſires, than the coming of their abſent Lord? how are their hopes ſolaced herein? what a vehement Indignation and Antipathie have they againſt al that may hinder their Lords approche? How much is their ſpiritual joy ſatisfied herein? What an holy fear have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53798:105"/>they of themſelves, leſt they ſhould be found ſhort in that day? Now theſe Affections thus exerciſed on our Lords ſecond coming, draw down powerful Influences, for the promoting of al manner of Godlineſſe. When Divine Affections are in conjunction with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day of God, what ſtrange and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Influences procede thence, for the begetting and encreaſing al manner of holy Coverſation and Godlineſſe? How holy, how Heavenly minded are ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now procede to the third Queſtion, <hi>What there is in the Effects of Chriſts coming, which renders our looking for, and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame ſo Influential?</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of Chriſt's coming are various and great. Wil he not then bring to Light al the Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of Darkeneſſe? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. Shal not al men be then recompenſed according to their workes? How ſoon wil the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be then ſeparated, and caſt into Hel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32, 33, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And as for the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> wil it not be a Day of Redemtion for them, as <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21? Shal not Chriſt receive them to himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. and they be ever with their Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13—17. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4? And O! what a Recompenſe of Reward wil Chriſt then give unto them, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26, 27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8? In ſhort; the Effects of Chriſts Coming may al be reduced to theſe two commun heads: (1.) <hi>The Torments of the Damned;</hi> (2.) <hi>The Saints Reſt.</hi> The
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53798:105"/>conſideration of theſe hath efficacious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on ſuch as wait for the coming of their Lord. But in as much as my contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on theſe two great <hi>effects,</hi> have exceded the proportion I allowed them in this ſhort Diſcourſe, I rather chooſe to publiſh them apart, if the Lord favor my deſires with an Opportunitie, and his Aſſiſtance.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Doctrine of Chriſts coming as before explicated, we may infer, <hi>That looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God comprehends the moſt noble and active part off the Divine life, both as to faith, and Godlineſſe.</hi> There are two main ſprings of the Divine life, <hi>contemplation of God</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>Action,</hi> or <hi>motion</hi> towards him: and doth not looking for, and haſtening unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord take in both of theſe? As for <hi>Contemplation</hi> of God in Chriſt, what pure, immixed, raiſed thoughts of God have ſuch, as daily expect the coming of Chriſt? How familiar, affectionate, and warme are their meditations of things ſpiritual? with what a fervor and vehemence do ſuch applie their minds to Divine objects? who more enured to Divine contemplation, than ſuch? What
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53798:106"/>more effectual to bind the thoughts to ſpiritual objects, than this looking for our coming Lord? Doth not this make you maſters of your thoughts, by forcing of them on Inviſible Glories? Who have more clear, real, and lively notions of the things of God than ſuch? What more efficacious to improve al objects your thoughts converſe with, to ſpiritualiſe al providences and enjoyments, than ſuch lively expectations of our Lords approche? In ſhort, may not this be eſtimed as <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi> whereby the ſoul aſcends up to God, and God deſcends down unto the ſoul?</p>
                  <p>So alſo for ſpiritual <hi>Action,</hi> which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther main part of the Divine life, what more powerful to <hi>fortifie, familiariſe,</hi> and <hi>ſweeten</hi> gracious exercices, than daily waiting for the coming of our Lord? Doth not this quicken, enlarge, refreſh, ſtrengthen, and eſtabliſh the ſoul in al holy duties? What more effectual to fil up al your time with proper duties? Doth not this bring the ſoul into the neareſt acceſſe to God? Is it not the wing, by which the ſoul retires into God? Doth it not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the heart to God, and cauſe it firmely to adhere to him? In ſum: Is not this looking for the coming of our Lord, the <hi>richeſt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, ſweeteſt, freeſt;</hi> moſt <hi>ſatisfying,</hi> moſt <hi>thriving,</hi> moſt <hi>harmonious</hi> life? Yea, doth it not come neareſt to the life of God? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts the life of God, but in the bleſſed <hi>Viſion,</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> of his own moſt perfect Being? And who have a more clear and real
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53798:107"/>
                     <hi>viſion</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> of God, than ſuch as daily <hi>look for,</hi> and <hi>haſten</hi> to the coming of our Lord? And doth it not hence follow, that this contains the moſt noble and active part of the Divine life? Oh! what a progreſſe hath he made in the Divine Life, whoſe heart is raiſed to a daily contemplation of and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, on the coming of the day of God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence alſo we ſee <hi>the true reaſon, why ſo many profeſſors, and ſome truely Godly, are ſo far behind in their Chriſtian Race, and have ſo much of their worke before them.</hi> It is ſtrange to conſider how long many have been in the Schole of Chriſt, and yet how far ſhort they are of others, who entred on the profeſſion of Chriſt long after them, Oh! how carnal, and darke are their notions of God in Chriſt? What cold and frozen Affections have they for God, and the things of God? How ſoon are they over-powered by a ſmal Tentation? What a burden is it to them to part with their burdens, that hinder them in their Chriſtian race? How much and how ſoon are they defiled with the pollutions of this world? And whence comes al this, but from want of ſerious, lively expectations of their Lords Approche? Believe it, there is a deep myſterie, a Spiritual Art and Skil in Godlineſſe, which none arrive unto ſo ſoon as they, who wait for the coming of their Lord. What made the Theſſalonians, in a ſhort time to arrive unto ſuch high pitches of Chriſtianitie, but that they imbibed, or ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, at their firſt Converſion, this principle,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53798:107"/>of waiting for the coming of their Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10? and O that profeſſors would trie this experiment! Verily, we ſhould not have ſuch complaints, decays, folies, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals among profeſſors, as now we every where find. It is a ſure and fixed Rule, <hi>That no one hath made a further proficience, in the ſchole of Chriſt, than he can with hope and Joy expect the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence likewiſe we may infer, <hi>That among the croud of profeſſors, few, yea very few, are acquainted with this great frame of looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God.</hi> (1.) Do not many, who profeſſe love to Chriſt, hate the thoughts of his coming, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4? (2.) How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there, who forſake their firſt love, and backſlide from Chriſt, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4? (3.) Can we ſuppoſe, that they look for the coming of their Lord, whoſe eyes are dazled with the fading beautie of this world? (4.) Do they look for the coming of their Lord, who ſleep ſecurely in the boſome of the times, and never mind their later end? (5.) Is it poſſible that they ſhould expect the coming of their Lord, who are drowned head and ears in the cares of this world; who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently purſue after the ſhadows of time, but are prodigiouſly ſluggiſh about the concernes of eternitie? (6.) May we imagine, that they look for the coming of their Lord, who cannot denie themſelves a toy, or ſenſual luſt for him, who indulge themſelves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of knowen ſins, and the omiſſion of

Laſtly, Hence learne, how greatly it does concerne us al, to entertain our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, with ſuch ſerious thoughts, and lively expectations of Chriſts ſecond coming. It has been in part diſcovered, what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuch thoughts have upon our preſent and everlaſting condition. O! then how ſhould this provoke us al to keep up ſuch ſerious freſh and lively thoughts of Chriſts ſecond
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53798:110"/>coming? Alas! what is it that makes the moſt of men ſo ſotiſhly ignorant of God; ſo ſenſual and brutiſh in their enjoyments; ſo careleſſe and regardleſſe of Heaven and Glorie; ſo ſecure and ſupine under al the threatnings of the Law, Hel, and everlaſting diſpleaſure? Is it not this, that men put far from them the evil day; they never have a ſerious thought of the ſecond coming of Chriſt to jugement. Surely, ſirs, would we but be ſerious in the conſideration of this great day, what a ſtrange alteration ſhould we find in mens lives? would the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous glutton, in the midſt of al his dainties, but take up a ſerious thought of Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, how ſoon would he turne his feaſting into faſting and prayer? would the ſwiniſh drunkard, in the midſt of al his careſſes, ſeriouſly conſider, that the Lord is coming, and wil ere long cal him to juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for al his bruitiſh wickedneſſe; ſurely every draught he drinkes would be but as gal and wormewood to his taſte. So for the profane Swearer and Blaſphemer of the name of God, would he but ſeriouſly conſider, that ere long he muſt anſwer, at the bar of divine Juſtice, for every idle word, how would he bridle his tongue, and watch over his lips? Likewiſe the covetous worldling, whoſe heart is in his bagges and barnes, would he but now and then conſider, that his Lord is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wil require an account of his ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip, how would he endeavor to make friends of the unrighteous Mammon? Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

My friends, you cannot imagine, what powerful influence ſuch ſerious thoughts of Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming would have upon mens hearts. Methinkes, the very thought, that our Lord Jeſus is coming to judge both quicke and dead; that it cannot be long ere that every ſoul here preſent muſt appear before his jugement Throne, and give an account of every thing done in the fleſh, and ſuch as are not found in Chriſt, ſhal then be turned into Hel, to lie under the ſcorching wrath of a ſin-revenging God, and that for ever, I ſay, ſuch thoughts as theſe, methinkes, ſhould ſtartle and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten every ſecure ſinner in this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.

And oh! what ſad mater of Lamentation is it to thinke, how far many Profeſſors ſal under this condemnation? Alas! how few underſtand what this means, to look for and haſten to the coming of the day of God? Where is the awakened ſoul, that ſtands on his watch tower, looking forth towards the coming of his Lord? when was it, that you had any lively heart-affecting views of that great day? Doth it not give us a dreadful prognoſtic, that ſome aſtoniſhing Jugement is at the dore, becauſe men ſo little
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53798:111"/>expect the great day of Jugement, at the coming of our Lord? Has it not ever been a ſad preſage of ſome impendent Jugements, if not ruine to a profeſſing people, when they have baniſht from their hearts al ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of future Jugement, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.9? O that profeſſors would daily be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for, and lament over this ſin, their not daily looking for, and haſtening to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day of God!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our ſubject affords us alſo mater of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Advice,</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> to profeſſors, and that chiefly in four particulars. (1.) That they beware of a carnally ſecure, ſleepy, and loitering ſpirit in their Chriſtian Race. O! what a contradiction is a ſleepy Chriſtian to the Religion he profeſſeth? How near akin is a ſleepy Chriſtian to a dead hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite? Its true, the Hypocrites ſpiritual death is a total <hi>privation</hi> of al principles of life: but doth not carnal ſecuritie bring a <hi>ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the Acts of life, even in a real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? O! beware of carnal ſecuritie after great peace and comforts, whether inward or outward. How doth carnal ſecuritie creep inſenſibly on moſt profeſſors, firſt or laſt? And what a danger are ſuch in of doſing their peace, exercices of Grace, and Communion with Chriſt? Remember, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecuritie comes not alone: and when it comes, it expoſeth you to the violent incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every Tentation: and, that which is worſt of al, it binds up al your ſpiritual ſenſes and Faculties; ſo that you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53798:112"/>look for, nor haſten unto the coming of the day of God. O! fear the terrors of the Lord at that great day. How are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of moſt men bound up with chains of ſecuritie; ſo that they cannot ſee or fear their miſerie, before they feel it?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Be adviſed alſo not to expect or deſire much Reſt in this Life. Remember it is inconſiſtent with your preſent ſtate, to have your Reſt here; becauſe you are now in your Motion and Race towards your approching Lord. The Saints triumph here lies in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts againſt ſin and tentation; his Reſt, in a life of faith under troubles. He that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects other Reſt here, wil find the greater troubles and diſappointment. And this alſo know, that the Hopes which a believer has, under al his troubles, of a Reſt, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Lord, are much better, than al the preſent enjoyments of others. Expectation of Reſt here is a great bar to our looking for the coming of our Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Beware of ſecret heart-back ſlidings from Chriſt: For theſe are moſt oppoſite to our looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the Day of God. It was the ſaying of an holy eminent Divine now in Glorie: <q>Thinke on this ſpeech, when you ſee me dead, that of al Churches in the World, the Lord Jeſus carries a moſt Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous eye, over theſe for whom he hath done ſuch great things: and I know it, he taketh exceding il your ſecret wantonneſſes, and whoredomes of heart.</q>

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:53798:112"/> 4. Take heed of a formal, remiſſe, ſleight ſpirit in private duties, or public Ordinances: For hereby you loſe your communion with Chriſt; and ſo, by conſequence, your look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and haſtening to the coming of the Day of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is alſo mater of <hi>Heart-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Whether we look for the coming of our Lord. Are our hearts taken off from gazing on the fading Glorie of this lower world? Do we value althings as they refer unto the coming of the Day of God? Are our ſouls drawen by the Glorie of that day, as the Iron is by the Load-ſtone? Do we by faith feed on the good things of that day? What influence hath the expectation of this day on our Hearts and lives? Are we made more holy and heavenly-minded here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? If it be thus with us, then al is wel. But if, after al our awakened thoughts, we are again grown ſecure, carnal, earthly-minded, formal in duties, proud, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in our ſelves, it is a black marque we look not for the coming of our Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Examine whether you are prepared to meet the Lord, when he comes. Suppoſe you ſhould this night hear the crie, <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!</hi> are you ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the wedding chamber? Have you the Wedding garment of Faith and Holineſſe? Do you ſtand with your loins girt, and your lamps burning, ever ready to entertain your Lord? How ſtands it with you in point of Aſſurance,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53798:113"/>and wel-grounded evidences, as to your eternal ſtate? Can you look Chriſt in the face with confidence, when he comes? Are you ſure your ſins are pardoned, and your perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted? Dare you look death in the face without change of countenance, when ever it comes? Remember, the Lord hath taken al other cares on himſelf, that ſo we might care for nothing, but to prepare for our Lords approche. Examine whether this be your care.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Examine wel both your <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Practice of Godlineſſe.</hi> Count nothing God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but what wil bear the fiery trial, at the coming of our Lord: let there not be a looſe pin in the main parts of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. Thinke oft, whither you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and where you ſhal loge at night: and this wil make you exceding accurate and curious, both in your notions, and practice of Godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here is mater of conviction, rebuke, and ſhame, both to ſecure ſinners, and Saints, who mind not the coming of the day of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Here is mater of conviction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to carnal ſecure ſinners, ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> propheſieth of, 2 Pet. 3.3, 4. <hi>Who walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own luſts: ſaying, where is the promiſſe of his coming.</hi> I fear there are too many, who pretend much friendſhip to Chriſt, and yet ſeldome or never think of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. I ſhal therefore take libertie, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the caſe with ſuch. Thou thinkeſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53798:113"/>it may be long enough ere Chriſt come, if he come at al: Mean while thou art reſolved to take thy fil of thy luſts. Very good: Ay, but what grounds haſt thou to thinke, it wil be long ere Chriſt come? Doth not the Scripture tel thee in expreſſe termes, <hi>the Judge ſtandeth at the dore,</hi> Jam. 5.9? and dareſt thou contemne plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? doeſt thou conſider whoſe word it is thou doeſt contemne? whoſe threats thou thinkeſt ſcorne of? Canſt thou not believe he is ſo near at hand? Why, yet believe that he wil ſurely come, firſt or laſt, and then cal thee to an account for al thine evil deeds? I ſay, do but believe this, and I queſtion not but it wil make thine heart to ake. Ay, but poſſibly thou mayſt preſume to find favor with him in that day: Why not? What ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! canſt thou expect to find favor in his eyes at laſt day, and yet deſpiſe, and reject al proffers of his Grace in this day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſpit in his face; and prefer a few ſenſual delights before him? Oh! what a fooliſh ſoul-deluding preſumtion is this? Its true, our great Lord is exceding merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, pure Grace, al love: But is he not alſo as juſt and righteous? Is it not a righteous thing with him to recompenſe tribulation to carnal ſecure ſinners? and, what! wouldſt thou have him unrighteous that he may ſhew mercie to thee? Ah! what a ſad contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this for awakened ſinners, to thinke, that God muſt either be unrighteous, or al their fooliſh hopes of mercie muſt periſh?
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53798:114"/>And let me tel thee, ſinner, the mercie and Free-grace of God wil be ſo far from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voriſing of thee, in that great day, if thou continueſt in thy ſin, as that it wil prove a ſtinging aggravation of thy miſerie. Oh! what a dreadful worme wil this breed in thy Conſcience, to be ſpurned into hel by a foot of Mercie and Grace? Do not thy hopes yet fail thee? Is not thine heart yet pained, and rent at the thoughts of thy Lords coming to Jugement? Doeſt thou not, as it were, ſee the Lord of Glorie coming in Chariots of flaming fire, to take vengeance on carnal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners? Methinkes, that voice ſhould be ever ringing in thine ears, <hi>Lo! Yonder, yonder comes the Judge of the whole Earth!</hi> What meaneſt thou, ſinner, by plodding, how thou mayſt keep thy luſts, and yet eſcape fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wrath? How long wilt thou procede to harden thy wicked heart to thine own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by putting far off the evil day? Aſſure thy ſelf the day of the Lord is never the farther off, for thy thinking it is ſo: but this advantage it wil have by the putting of it far off, it wil ſurpriſe thee unawares. And what wil become of al thy fond hopes and groundleſſe preſumtions? how wil al thy cruel ſelf-flatteries end in everlaſting horror, confuſion, diſappointment and deſpair?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Here is mater of conviction and ſhame even to Believers, to thinke how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the moſt of them have their thoughts fixed on the ſecond coming of their Lord. Alas! how little are your expectations of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53798:114"/>that great day raiſed? How coldly and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do your Affections worke towards that good time? Ah Sirs! are there ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things to be reveled then? and hath the forethoughts hereof ſo much influence, upon al manner of holy Converſation and Godlineſſe? How comes it to paſſe then, that Believers have their hearts no more bent towards this great day? How comes it to paſſe, that their Affections are not carried out more to meet their approching Lord? Is it not ſtrange, that Chriſtians ſhould be ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſo low in the thoughts of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious day? Alas! where can we ſpend our meditations better than to meet our Lord? where can the Spouſe better employ her thoughts and affections, than with her abſent Husband? Who ſhould look towards the coming of their friend, their Savior, if not Believers? As for the ſecure world no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they endeavor to ſtifle al thoughts of their Lords approche, ſithat it wil be a black day to them: But as for believers, O! what a joyful time wil it be to them? Wil it not be the time of their complete redemtion, their mariage-day? Should not their thoughts therefore be always muſing on this day? How ſhould their hearts leap for joy, at the very reports of it? But is it thus with them? Are not al too much ſtrangers to this day? And oh! what an hainous ſin is it for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not to look for this great day?</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53798:115"/>Is it poſſible that the member ſhould forget its Head? Was it ever known, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate faithful Spouſe forgat her abſent husband? Is it not then ſtrange unkindneſſe, that the members of Chriſt ſhould put far from them the coming of their Head, and Lord?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) What a ſtrange violence do ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to al the principles of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Is there any thing more injurious to the divine nature, than not to mind the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche of Chriſt? Doth not this greatly provoke and grieve the Spirit of Adoption? How is faith oppreſt, and kept under hereby? What a check and contradiction is this to al Divine Affections?</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) For Believers not to mind the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Lord, is a ſin againſt the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and deepeſt obligations. Doth not this oppoſe al our Covenants, Reſolutions, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, Ordinances; yea, the bloud and heart of our dying and exalted Savior?

                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:53798:115"/> (5.) Yea, how cruel and injurious are ſuch to their own ſouls? What a ſting and poiſon doth this put into every affliction? How doth it embitter the ſweeteſt mercies? Yea, doth it not open a dore to al tentations, and leave men ſhiftleſſe under the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us then al be exhorted henceforth daily to look for, and haſten unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord. And to provoke our hearts hereto, let theſe following motives be duely conſidered by us.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Is not that great day our time of Reſt? and do not al mind their Reſt, ſpecially after hard labor, and a tireſome journey? would not al fain be at home, when night comes? What is this world, but our Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Conſider the nearneſſe of your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the manifold engagements you ſtand in unto Chriſt. Are you not maried unto Chriſt? and doth not the law of mariage require, that you daily expect the coming of your abſent husband? Remember you are not maried to the clay-Gods of time, but to Chriſt, who has laid infinite obligations on you, daily to expect his returne.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Conſider alſo Chriſts Regard, and Affection towards you. Though his Bodie be in the ſupreme Heaven, yet is not his eye of pitie and care; yea, and his heart with you? Doth he not long for you? and wil you not alſo long for him?</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:53798:116"/> (4.) Remember alſo what Influence this looking for your approching Lord hath on your heart and ways. O! What Vigor and Strength doth it infuſe into al that you do or ſuffer? How much is the heart hereby fortified againſt al tentations and difficulties? This wil be wings and ſpurs to the ſoul in every dutie: The more you eye your home, the more active wil you be in your way.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Is not this likewiſe your Glorie and triumphe, to turne your back on althings of time, and daily to look for, and haſten to the coming of your Lord? Are you not hereby advanced into the higheſt forme of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; yea, taken up into the very ſpirit and life of Heaven? Have you not hereby a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Heaven, a ſtampe of Glorie on your hearts and lives?</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Remember, that al you do for your ſouls, without a regard to the coming of the day of God, is nothing. You neither mind, nor affect, nor act any thing to purpoſe, longer than you mind your Lords approche. What is al your Religion without this, but a dreaming, ſleepy, loitering formalitie? Al your <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>paſſions</hi> for God, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not to this day, are loſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) To look for and haſten unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Lord, puts you into a ſtate of Libertie and freedome: it makes you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne Citizens of Heaven, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Whereas al others are chained to the Idols of time, priſoners to their luſts, of ſervile ignoble ſpirits. Nothing brings ſo much
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53798:116"/>
                     <hi>Amplitude</hi> and <hi>Libertie</hi> of heart and ways, as daily looking for that great Day.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) Remember the judge ſtandeth at the dore; you are on the brink of Eternitie; and dare you ſleep or loiter, when the judge is ſo near? Is it not prodigious folie, to lie dreaming on the precipice of Eternitie? If you look not for the coming of your Lord, is it not a black marque, that wrath and jugement look for you? Have you not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe to queſtion your Intereſt in Chriſt, if you altogether neglect and diſregard his ſecond coming?</p>
                  <p n="9">(9.) Know that your choiſeſt comforts, peace, hopes, Graces, with the whole of the Divine Life depend greatly on your looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of your Lord. Chriſt wil never honor you with much peace, joy, and Grace, if you wil not honor him with looking for and haſtening unto his ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p>(10.) Future Bleſſedneſſe is entailed on our preſent looking for and haſtening unto the coming of our Lord. Thus Heb. 9.28. <hi>And to them that look for him, ſhal he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the ſecond time without ſin, unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> So that you ſee Chriſt wil appear to none in a way of ſalvation but ſuch as look for him.</p>
                  <p>(11.) Doth not the whole Creation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the ſecure ſleepy world, look for the coming of our Lord, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21. and wil you not do the ſame?</p>
                  <p>(12.) Laſtly, To be altogether unmindful

Oh! then what a ſad death is it, to be deprived, either in part or in whole, of that which is your higheſt life? To be dead to Chriſt and his ſecond coming, which brings eternal life, what a miſerable death is this? Is not al life dead and gone, if your looking for your Lords returne be dead and gone?</p>
                  <p>To give a few Directions for our better looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of our Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Make the promiſſe the meſure of thine expectations; and let thy ſpirit be unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, til thou haſt got ſome aſſurance of an intereſt in the good things promiſſed, at the coming of thy Lord.</hi> As the promiſſe alone can give being to thy faith and hopes; ſo the Aſſurance of an intereſt in the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, gives life and vigor to thy looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of thy Lord. Thou canſt not hope for the coming of thy Lord, without a promiſſe; neither wilt thou haſten towards it, without ſome perſuaſion of an Intereſt in the things promiſſed. Leave not ſoul-concernes under any hazards, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventures: Reſt not ſatisfied in any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'til you are ſure, you can look Chriſt in the face, when he comes, without fear or ſhame. In order hereto caſt up your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts daily; and never be ſatisfied without ſome aſſurance your ſins are pardoned.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:53798:118"/> (2.) <hi>Be ever parting with the Idols of time:</hi> Let no falſe God, or Image of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie loge in your heart. Remember the Lord uſually conveigheth his moſt deadly poiſon, through the ſweet wine of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. O! how many, by having their eyes dazled with the glorie of this world, have loſt the ſight of their Lords approche? How ſoon are our eyes miſted, and hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with the golden pleaſures of that heart-inveigling Idol, the World? Oh! at what a diſtance ought we to keep from the wals of this Peſt-houſe? what have we to do with this dirty Idol, which the degenerate Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> Worſhip and adore?</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Let your Thoughts and Affections ever worke according to the Dignitie of thoſe objects you expect, at the coming of your Lord, and your Relation to them.</hi> Haſt thou a clear apprehenſion of thy Lords approche, and ſome Aſſurance of an Intereſt in him? O! then how ſhould thy Love, by al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vehement exercices both of deſire, hope, Joy and ſatisfaction, move towards thy Lord? Or, doeſt thou behold the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Lord, but want a prevalent aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an Intereſt in him? what an holy awe and filial fear of thy Lord; what hatred and Indignation againſt ſin oughteſt thou to have?</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Make frequent ſuppoſitions of thy Lords Approche; and thinke what thoughts thou wilt then have of things.</hi> Remember, with what ſwift wings time poſteth away, and

                  <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Do nothing, but what thou wouldeſt do, if the Lord were come.</hi> This wil give thee much confidence in looking for the coming of thy Lord. They, who meſure al their Actions by that day, wil not care how ſoon it come. Such as keep their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in an abſolute ſubmiſſion to the Divine wil, both as to doing and ſuffering, are in the fitteſt poſture to entertain their Lord. The reaſon why the moſt of men are ſo averſe from looking for, and haſtening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coming of the day of God, is the <hi>Irregularitie</hi> of their <hi>Actions,</hi> which they know wil not bear the trial, of that day.</p>

Dread a loitering formal ſpirit as much as Hel.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) <hi>Muſe and conſider much on the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects, which follow the coming of the day of God.</hi> Remember that thy preſent thirſty deſires, wil then be turned into a love of Fruition and complacence. How ſoon wil the Saints preſent tears be changed into eternal joys? O! what an excellent thing is Heaven? Doth it not as much (or much more) excede our preſent apprehenſions, as our preſent apprehenſions excede our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyments? What are al preſent enjoyments, whether ſpiritual or temporal, but ſhadows, in compariſon of thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial enjoyments? Yea, al we here enjoy is ſcarce a picture of that glorious ſtate. O! what a bleſſed day wil that be, when the Saints ſhal leave, though not their Natures, yet al their imperfections both natural and ſinful? When al their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Darkneſſes, Errors, and Douts, ſhal end in the beatific Viſion of God, as he is, face to face: When al their Rebellions of heart, ſhal end in a perfect conformitie and ſubjection to the Divine Wil: When al their unlawful paſſions and exorbitant Affections ſhal end in a regular harmonie and motion:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53798:121"/>when al their Deadneſſes in Duties, ſhal end in the moſt vigorous and lively exercices of al manner of Graces: When al their convulſions and terrors of Conſcience ſhal end in complete aſſurance of Gods Love: when al their Diſtances and Eſtrangements from God ſhal end in perfect Union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God: When al their troubles, diſguſts, and diſſatisfactions in this world ſhal end in perfect Reſt and Satisfaction: O! what a glorious bleſſed Day wil this be? How would the ſerious and lively views here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by faith fixe the heart, in looking for and haſtening to the coming of the Day of God?</p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) <hi>Familiariſe thoughts of death unto thy ſoul; and never reſt ſatisfied, 'til thou haſt brought thine heart to a wel-grounded, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful willingneſſe to be diſſolved.</hi> None look for and haſten to the coming of their Lord, ſo much as they who daily wait for their change. O! how welcome is death, when it comes, to thoſe, who daily look for it? Who live better lives, than they, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually thinke of death? What more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engageth men to die unto althings of time, than daily expectations of Death? They who look for the dreadful hour of Death and Jugement, how much do they deſpiſe al the dreadful things of this life? Remember, that death comes not the ſooner for your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: But the more you look for it, the better prepared you wil be to entertain it, when it comes: You wil die out of choice,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53798:121"/>not merely from neceſſitie. I ſhal conclude with a great ſaying, of that holy man, Mr. <hi>John Rowe,</hi> (p. 124. of his life), when he drew near to death; <hi>why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhould we not be willing to die: Chriſt came from Heaven to Earth, to free us from ſin and miſerie, and why ſhould not we be willing, to go from Earth to Heaven, to be freed from ſin and miſerie?</hi>
